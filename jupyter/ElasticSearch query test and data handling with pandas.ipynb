After the pick-up in EM \\n\\nvolatility earlier this year, vol now looks to be spilling over into DM. Our analysts \\n\\ndiscuss whether volatility has returned, alongside possible catalysts for sustaining \\n\\nhigher DM vol, including US mid-term elections and continuing Italian concerns. \\n\\nWe then discuss the implications of higher vol across asset classes. In rates, we note \\n\\nhow the pick-up in vol is more acute in long-dated vols than short-dated vols – a clear \\n\\ncontrast to the moves we saw in the February equity sell-off. In FX, the EUR is \\n\\ndisplaying higher realised vol than its G10 counterparts. Finally, in EM we expect \\n\\nfurther headwinds from tight financial conditions and trade protectionism to prevent \\n\\nvolatility from fading. In summary, we think that a new volatility wave is under way. \\n\\nPart II: RORO Resurgence \\n\\nCross-asset correlations are exhibiting a distinctly Risk On – Risk Off (RORO) profile. \\n\\nIt appears that the RORO paradigm acts as a muscle memory in periods where \\n\\nvolatility picks up and global equities sell off.  \\n\\nThis structure of cross-asset correlations fits well with our broad strategy view. We \\n\\nstill favour US equities over Europe and we remain cautious about EM given the \\n\\ncurrent environment. Meanwhile, we have a bearish credit outlook in Europe and \\n\\nAsia (neutral US), and maintain our bullish US Treasuries view – we look through to \\n\\n2020 when we expect Fed rate cuts. We continue to look for further USD \\n\\nappreciation as the Fed delivers on its dots for now, but would also expect the USD \\n\\nto gain if the US economy slows materially. In summary: we still broadly favour USD \\n\\nassets. \\n\\nWe highlight key HSBC Global Research publications across asset classes: \\n\\n\\uf034 Multi-asset Why EM matters tactically \\n\\uf034 FX USD bears laid bare: Currency Outlook \\n\\uf034 Fixed Income Looking right through \\n\\uf034 Economics Diverging Fortunes \\n\\uf034 EM Shaky foundations \\n\\uf034 Global Equities Shaken but not stirred \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nPierre Blanchet \\nHead of Multi Asset Strategy \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\npierre.blanchet@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 5388 \\n\\nSteven Major, CFA \\nGlobal Head of Fixed Income Research  \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nsteven.j.major@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 5980 \\n\\nMark McDonald \\nHead of FX Quantitative Strategy \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nmark.mcdonald@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 5966 \\n\\nDr. Murat Ulgen \\nGlobal Head of Emerging Markets Research \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nmuratulgen@hsbc.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 6782 \\n\\nDavid Bloom \\nGlobal Head of FX Research \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\ndavid.bloom@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 5969 \\n\\nSubhrajit Banerjee, CFA \\nFixed Income Strategist \\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nsubhrajit.banerjee@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 6851 \\n\\nAndre de Silva, CFA \\nHead of Global EM Rates Research \\nThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited \\n\\nandre.de.silva@hsbc.com.hk \\n\\n+852 2822 2217 \\n\\nFabio Balboni \\nEuropean Economist \\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nfabio.balboni@hsbc.com \\n\\n+44 20 7992 0374 \\n\\nChris Attfield \\nStrategist \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nchristopher.attfield@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 2133 \\n\\nDaniel Grosvenor* \\nEquity Strategist \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\ndaniel.grosvenor@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 4246 \\n\\nMax Kettner \\nMulti Asset Strategist \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nmaximilian.l.kettner@hsbc.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 5045 \\n\\n \\n\\n* Employed by a non-US affiliate of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc, and is \\nnot registered/ qualified pursuant to FINRA regulations \\n\\nMulti-Asset Analysts\\' Meeting MULTI-ASSET GLOBAL \\n\\n \\n\\n       RORO, Muscle Memory, and the rise of Vol \\n\\nhttp://www.research.hsbc.com/\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/7zbjjzk\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/kWXcrlD\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/vkpJLDX\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/X9dkpHm\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/PdZRCSQ\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n \\n\\nPart I: The return of volatility \\n\\n \\n\\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nGood afternoon everyone. \\n\\nFollowing the recent market sell-off, we’d like to discuss the topics of volatility and correlation, and \\n\\nimplications across the asset classes. Mark is there evidence of a return of volatility? \\n\\n \\n\\nMark McDonald \\n\\nOur Cross-Asset Volatility Indicator (CRAVIN, Figure 1) is definitely not low anymore as it’s back in the \\n\\n25-75 percentile range, but it’s not at objectively high levels either. It does look like we have passed the \\n\\nlows in vol, particularly when you take this information in conjunction with our volatility wave analysis \\n\\n(Figure 2). A new volatility wave is building, and the volatility wave chart suggests that once volatility \\n\\npicks up in some asset classes, it typically spills over into others. \\n\\n Figure 1: Our Cross-asset Volatility Indicator (CRAVIN) \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n Figure 2: A new wave of Vol is starting to develop  \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nAt the start of this wave, increased vol was just an EM phenomenon. Now are you suggesting that \\n\\nvolatility is rising in DM, too? \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nYes – in August we highlighted this volatility divergence between EM and DM (see EM-DM vol \\n\\ndivergence, 8 August 2018). Back then, the EM vol premium was high, whereas the DM vol premium \\n\\nremained low, suggesting that the market was happy for this divergence to continue. That has now \\n\\nchanged. With the recent equity sell-off implied vols are definitely higher now across DM too, although \\n\\nthere is not enough data to know whether realised vol in DM has picked up. The sort of complacency in \\n\\nthe pricing of DM vols that we saw in the summer has gone. \\n\\n Figure 3: Implied volatilities of DM Equity and Rates have risen \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nI suppose the catalyst for sustaining higher vol. could be political uncertainties. Ryan, we have the \\n\\nUS mid-terms just around the corner. Could they become a source of volatility? \\n\\n \\n\\nRyan Wang \\n\\nThe outlook for the US mid-terms hasn’t changed considerably over the last month. It’s still \\n\\nanticipated from the polling data we have, that the Democrats will take control of the House of \\n\\nRepresentatives. The Senate is much less likely to switch control from its current Republican \\n\\nmajority (see US Midterm Elections, Divided Congress still possible, 22 October 2018).  \\n\\nIrrespective of the election results, it doesn’t look like the issue of trade protectionism will go away. \\n\\nThere is a scheduled increase in US tariffs to 25% from 10% on USD200bn of imports from China. If \\n\\nthat were to take effect at the start of next year, then investors might start to worry about the risk of a \\n\\nthird tranche of tariffs, potentially impacting all US imports from China. \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nIn Europe, although Brexit uncertainties might be close to an end, Italy puts the European Union in \\n\\nunchartered territories. Fabio, Chris, do you think Italy can remain a source of market volatility? \\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n60\\n\\n65\\n\\n70\\n\\n75\\n\\n80\\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\nJan-18 Feb-18 Mar-18 Apr-18 May-18 Jun-18 Jul-18 Aug-18 Sep-18 Oct-18\\n\\nEquity Implied Vol (percentage points, LHS) Rates Implied Vol (basis points, RHS)\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/VPjRvr2\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/VPjRvr2\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/N72wzQrjvvqx\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\n\\nFabio Balboni \\n\\nMoody\\'s downward revision of Italy’s sovereign rating but with a stable outlook was seen with some \\n\\nrelief by markets. But it changes very little of the overall outlook and risks. Last week the European \\n\\nCommission (EC) sent a letter to the Italian government noting the \"unprecedented\" divergence \\n\\nbetween the proposed deficit and the target agreed with the EU, effectively preparing the ground to \\n\\nbring Italy under the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). If the Italian government sticks to its \\n\\n2.4% of GDP deficit target – which so far it has said it will (La Repubblica, 22 October 2018) – then \\n\\nwe think the EC will have no option but to propose to bring Italy back under the EDP, to preserve its \\n\\ncredibility and avoid setting dangerous precedents. This could happen relatively quickly, even before \\n\\nthe end of the year (see Italy’s 2019 draft budget, 16 October 2018). Hence, there might still be more \\n\\n‘bad news’ for the market to digest in the next few weeks, creating some volatility, including the \\n\\npossibly of a downgrade by S&P on 26 October. \\n\\n \\n\\nChris Attfield \\n\\nIn a market where 30bp+ moves appear to be the ‘new normal’, forecasting is not about any \\n\\nmeasure of “fair value.” Even though a rating-based approach shows Italy is trading in deeply cheap \\n\\nterritory for an IG sovereign, we think this can easily continue in the medium term. For 2019, our \\n\\nbase case is still that a systemic crisis will be averted, and that redenomination risk will not be priced \\n\\ninto the market to any significant degree. Therefore, a level of 200bp by the end of next year seems \\n\\nreasonable: it may be optimistic, but we think 300bp is too wide for an equilibrium to be reached. \\n\\nAlthough Italian risks remain a concern, we note value in the short end of Spain as it has displayed \\n\\nlow volatility to BTPs in 2018 and relatively attractive carry (see The proper pricing of policy, 19 \\n\\nOctober 2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nLet’s talk about the implications across the asset classes. Subhrajit, do we see changes in the vol \\n\\ndynamic of rates markets? Is it different from what we’d seen in February this year? \\n\\n \\n\\nSubhrajit Banerjee \\n\\nWe can definitely see that rates vol has picked up in certain segments of the bond market. This is \\n\\nespecially notable with the EUR interest rate vol, which was quite low to begin with. An interesting \\n\\nphenomena is occurring when you compare short-dated vol. with long-dated vol, especially in the USD \\n\\nrates market. In February, when we saw a similar volatility pick-up, it was much more pronounced in \\n\\nshort-dated vol. versus long-dated vol. – a move stemming from uncertainty over monetary policy \\n\\nexpectations. This time, however, we are seeing a more aggressive pick-up in long-dated vols. This is \\n\\nan interesting development and something we will watch closely as it shows the rates vol. dynamic has \\n\\nchanged. \\n\\n \\n\\nSteven Major \\n\\nThis temporary move in the curve is getting a lot of attention. Are these moves mostly confined to real \\n\\nrates and its volatility? \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/Z6gthRvPjDIr\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/VpjL7FLxchvm\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nSubhrajit Banerjee \\n\\nYes. When we look at long-dated interest rate vol this can be split into two categories. One is real yield \\n\\nvol. and another one is inflation risk premia. Recently, the inflation risk premia has remained calm while \\n\\nvolatility is seen more on the real yield front. Adjustments happen on real yields, which begs the \\n\\nquestion about the uncertainty about the level of R*. \\n\\n Figure 4 : Vol seen to have increased mostly via the real yield channel \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n* Realised vol calculated using trailing 6m window \\n \\n\\n \\nSteven Major \\n\\nThe point we’d make more broadly is that the longer-term forward rates are barely above the Fed’s \\n\\nsupposed equilibrium rate. Larry, do you have anything to add on this? \\n\\n \\n\\nLawrence Dyer \\n\\nWe would expect a consolidation given the historical pattern – the high 5Y5Y forward rate (3.35%) \\n\\nsuggest the market is already pricing in the Fed’s tightening plans. So unless you anticipate that the \\n\\nFed could move its funds rate up towards 3.75% or more, there is little reason to expect long rates to \\n\\npush much higher. The distribution of the longer-run funds rate in the dot plot suggests the FOMC sees \\n\\nthe risks as biased to lower rate. One dot is at 3.5%, the other fifteen dots are below the current 5Y5Y \\n\\nforward. There are seven at 2.75% or less, and eight if you consider that one member refuses to even \\n\\nguess the longer-run rate, but has a 2.125% rate in 2021. \\n\\n \\n\\nMax Kettner \\n\\nFrom a multi-asset perspective, if real yields continue to rise and volatility picks up further, then that \\n\\nusually has implications for credit and equity. Although there is considerable uncertainty around the \\n\\nrelationship between real yields and equity multiples, a level of 10-year real yields of c1.5% was \\n\\nconsistent with equity multiples no longer expanding. Credit IG is more exposed to rates vol and HY is \\n\\nmore exposed to equity vol. So rising rates and equity volatility can negatively impact the risk profile of \\n\\nUSD credit, and probably EUR credit.  \\n\\n0.6\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.8\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n1.3\\n\\n1.4\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n60\\n\\n70\\n\\n80\\n\\n90\\n\\n100\\n\\nDec-15 Jun-16 Dec-16 Jun-17 Dec-17 Jun-18\\n\\nV\\no\\n\\nl r\\nat\\n\\nio\\n\\nR\\nea\\n\\nlis\\ned\\n\\n V\\no\\n\\nl *\\n  (\\n\\nb\\np\\n\\n)\\n\\nUSD 5y5y real yield vol USD 5y5y inflation swap vol Vol ratio (RHS)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n Figure 5 : A further rise in real yields may not support equity multiples \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nMark, you wrote that EUR FX volatility has a different dynamic to the rest of G10 FX. \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nFor most G10 currency pairs, realised vol is still at the low end of its previous six-month range. Yet for \\n\\nalmost all EUR crosses, realised vol is at the high end of its six-month range (see Data Matters: RORO \\n\\nResurgence, 17 October 2018). For example, we see EUR-JPY vol is high, but USD-JPY vol is low. \\n\\nClearly, this needs an EUR-specific explanation.  \\n\\nWe believe such behaviour might be due to worries about Italy, and to some extent Turkey. When \\n\\nTurkey was selling off, there were worries about contagion to the European banking system and, \\n\\nhence, European assets came under pressure. These are the sort of linkages that display the ways \\n\\nthat volatility can spill from one asset class to another. \\n\\n-5\\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12\\n\\nC\\nA\\n\\nP\\nE\\n\\nReal 10-year US Treasury yield (using CPI)\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdS\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdS\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n Figure 6: Most EUR crosses display higher vol \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, emerging markets have initiated a vol dynamic. David, is there risk surrounding \\n\\ngreater volatility in USD-RMB? \\n\\n \\n\\nDavid Bloom \\n\\nEffectively we are seeing USD-RMB weakening, but not necessarily with a spike in volatility. Instead \\n\\nwe have seen and continue to expect a gradual depreciation of the RMB over time. As such, we are \\n\\nforecasting USD-CNY at 7.10 by end-2019. But that gradual process would not substantially increase \\n\\nvolatility. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n \\n\\nMurat Ulgen \\n\\nFrom a top-down EM perspective, the key issues are trade protectionism, slowing growth, and \\n\\ntightening financial conditions. But coming back to the previous discussion about rising real rates – \\n\\nboth on the level and volatility – this has been an issue in so far that the real rate gap between EM and \\n\\nthe US is narrowing. Consequently, the re-pricing of risk premium in emerging markets may not be \\n\\nover. A narrowing gap will continue to be a drag on EM in the background. \\n\\n \\n\\nAndre De Silva \\n\\nThe real yield differential between EM and DM has indeed narrowed, but it is still sizeable. Moreover, if \\n\\none decomposes the individual countries this indicates more dispersion. The real yield bond valuations \\n\\nin Indonesia are quite generous in light of policy tightening during a period of subdued inflation. In \\n\\ncontrast, the surge in inflation in Turkey has put real yields in negative territory.  \\n\\nFor emerging market bonds, one key source of volatility has been EM FX and reflects a key \\n\\ncomponent of tightening of financial conditions that Murat Ulgen referred to earlier. Prior to September, \\n\\nEM FX had lost nearly 20% year-to-date. Since then we have seen these currencies stabilise or even \\n\\nbounce back somewhat. The main issues of Fed tightening and US-China trade tensions remain, but \\n\\nthese factors are well known. The policy adjustment from several EM countries is also starting to bite, \\n\\nranging from 150bp rate hikes from Indonesia, the second round of accelerated IMF funding for \\n\\nArgentina, and Russia surprising the markets with a rate hike and a sprinkling of other measures to \\n\\nrestrict imports and stem price pressures. One sign of a reassessment of EM bonds, even if FX risks \\n\\nremain, is the re-tightening of EM external debt spreads since the peak of above 400bp in the JPM \\n\\nEMBI during early September vs c300bp earlier this year.       \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nThanks Andre. We’ve seen some positive stories in EM. In Brazil, expectations about the election \\n\\ndelivering a market-friendly outcome has seen the BRL rally. In Turkey, the narrowing of the geo-\\n\\npolitical risk premium and a C/A surplus has seen the TRY rally.  \\n\\nMurat, could this be enough for EM volatility to fall and EM FX vols to settle down? \\n\\n \\nMurat Ulgen \\n\\nNo, not necessarily. I would still consider tightening financial conditions and trade protectionism as \\n\\nsecular dynamica in the background negatively impacting EM sentiment and therefore volatility. As \\n\\nRyan mentioned earlier, it doesn’t look like any of these factors will go away anytime soon. There is a \\n\\nG20 summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November. Unless there is a breakthrough on the ongoing \\n\\nUS-China trade disputes at this summit, it seems trade protectionism issues will likely linger into 2019. \\n\\nGiven the Fed’s trajectory, many EM economies with C/A deficits are seeing capital being withdrawn. \\n\\nHence, to stem the tide these countries have to raise interest rates – so further tightening financial \\n\\nconditions as we have already seen in 2Q18 and 3Q18. \\n\\nBoth issues not only present downside risk to EM growth but in certain countries upside risks to \\n\\ninflation as well (see GEMS Investor, 7 October 2018). \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/PdZRCSQ\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n9 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\n\\nAli Cakiroglu \\n\\nJust to add on EM growth – the consensus forecast is for 5% GDP growth in EM during 2019.

The typical RORO correlation profile is positive correlations among risk-on assets, positive \\n\\ncorrelations among risk-off assets and, critically, a negative correlation between these two asset blocks. \\n\\nAlthough the overall level of correlations is nowhere near the extreme levels such as in 2012, that profile of \\n\\ncross asset correlations has come back.  \\n\\nWe’ve been highlighting for a while that we see signs of the RORO factor lurking in the background of cross-\\n\\nasset returns. What’s changed is that we now see a ‘RORO-esque’ heat map. Cross-asset correlations \\n\\nbegan to rise in August, so it’s not purely driven by the recent equity market sell-off. Interestingly, many \\n\\npeople are blaming higher yields for the sell-off in equities, which would suggest a positive correlation \\n\\nbetween bond and equity returns. However, there is still a negative correlation between the two. So while \\n\\nhigher yields are likely to be an important driver of the equity sell-off, this suggests to us that there have also \\n\\nbeen other drivers at work. Looking for a single factor that explains the equity sell-off is overly simplistic \\n\\nhere. \\n\\n Figure 9: Our RORO index has increased since August \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nFrom a multi-asset perspective, the issue is that when assets lose their specific identities, asset allocators \\n\\nfind it much more difficult to express specific views or themes to find effective diversification. Can you \\n\\nremind us what it was like when correlations were at their extremes? \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdSjvvqx\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nBack in 2012 most assets lost much of their individual character. Assets partitioned themselves into either a \\n\\nrisk-on or a risk-off bucket and the majority of their price action was explained by the common factor. This \\n\\ncaused significant problems for asset managers – there was little benefit to being an asset class expert \\n\\nduring this time since the overwhelming influence on the resulting P&L was the change in overall risk \\n\\nsentiment.  \\n\\nNow, clearly the correlations we’re seeing at the moment are nowhere near those levels. But the presence \\n\\nof this correlation structure coming back during a challenging time for markets does suggest that we may \\n\\nhave what I call a kind of ‘muscle memory’ in markets. Investors simply switch back to these risk on / risk off \\n\\nbehaviours at times of stress. \\n\\n Figure 10: Once again we see two clear blocks of assets: risk-on assets, and ‘safe havens’ \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nDaniel Grosvenor \\n\\nFor equities, I think it is interesting that the relationship between the typical ‘bond proxy’ sectors and the \\n\\ndevelopment of rates seems to have broken down (see Global Equity Insights: Shaken but not stirred, 11 \\n\\nOctober 2018). Normally when bond yields rise these sectors tend to sell-off as well. But they have \\n\\nactually been quite resilient over the past month or so. I think this reflects their defensive nature and \\n\\nsuggests that investors are worried about the outlook for growth, consequently favouring these sectors. \\n\\nHaving underperformed for most of the past two years, defensives are now outperforming again. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n Figure 11 : Breaking down the bond-equity correlation \\n\\n \\nSource: Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nSo you think global equity markets are already transitioning to this new paradigm? \\n\\n \\nDaniel Grosvenor \\n\\nIn our Global Equity Strategy Quarterly, we wrote about the risk from a rise in volatility, particularly in DM, \\n\\nand the pressure this could have on valuations (see Global Equity Strategy: Extend and defend, 1 October \\n\\n2018). And I think this has already partly played out. The global 12m forward PE ratio has fallen to just \\n\\n14.2x. In January, it was almost 17x, and the long-term average is 15.8x. So valuations have already \\n\\ncorrected significantly.  \\n\\nThe issue is that these valuation multiples are underpinned by relatively strong consensus growth \\n\\nexpectations. If you get disappointment there, then of course equities don’t appear as cheap anymore. \\n\\nThis leads us to our preference for the US, as we are comfortable with the US earnings outlook where \\n\\nexpectations are for c10% EPS growth in 2019. We are more concerned elsewhere, and particularly in \\n\\nEurope where we see further downward revisions.  It is difficult to see what drives a reacceleration in \\n\\nEuropean earnings momentum from here (see European Equity Insights: Still waiting for a growth spurt, \\n\\n17 September 2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nThanks Dan. Steve is this an inflexion point? \\n\\n \\nSteven Major \\n\\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect about an inflexion point is that this does not necessarily tell us anything \\n\\nabout the future direction. It’s a turning point and we could simply go back to the old regime – we are simply \\n\\nnot meant to know until afterwards. If we’ve learned anything about the past ten years of QE and excess \\n\\ndebt is that traditional wisdom does not necessarily apply any longer. So I’m prepared to challenge the idea \\n\\nof historical precedence to make predictions (see Reversal: Behaviour shifts as QE era end, 31 August \\n\\n2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nFrom an asset allocation perspective, our view is that investors shouldn’t be complacent (Multi-asset \\n\\nStrategy, 5 October 2018). Rising correlations will impact portfolio construction and risk management. \\n\\nInvestors have to start thinking about moving toward more cautious allocations such as reducing credit \\n\\nexposure.  \\n\\n-80%\\n\\n-60%\\n\\n-40%\\n\\n-20%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n20%\\n\\n40%\\n\\n60%\\n\\n80%\\n\\nIn\\ndu\\n\\nst\\nria\\n\\nls\\n\\nF\\nin\\n\\nan\\nci\\n\\nal\\ns\\n\\nF\\nin\\n\\nan\\nci\\n\\nal\\ns\\n\\nE\\nne\\n\\nrg\\ny\\n\\nH\\nea\\n\\nlth\\n C\\n\\nar\\ne\\n\\nT\\nel\\n\\nec\\nom\\n\\ns\\n\\nU\\ntil\\n\\niti\\nes\\n\\nC\\non\\n\\ns.\\n S\\n\\nta\\npl\\n\\nes\\n\\nC\\non\\n\\ns.\\n D\\n\\nis\\nc.

The ingredients of higher \\n\\nUS Treasury yields, stronger dollar and tighter dollar financial conditions would in the past typically impact \\n\\nLatAm the most, especially Brazil and Mexico. However, this time around it’s driven much more by \\n\\nidiosyncratic stories. In Brazil, this has to do with elections and hopes for more market-friendly policies. In \\n\\nMexico, there is still the NAFTA risk being reduced. In contrast, Asia has very recently borne more the brunt \\n\\nof higher volatility. Perhaps this also has to do with the rise in oil prices, which Asia is much more exposed \\n\\nto, particularly India and to a certain degree also Indonesia. In China, concerns still linger about the trade \\n\\nconflict. So we think fundamentally there is a good reason why we have seen this shift of ‘old’ correlation \\n\\npatterns. \\n\\n \\nSubhrajit Banerjee \\n\\nWe’ve found similar dynamics in Data Matters (17 October 2018), for example in short-dated EM rates. \\n\\nAlthough most central banks have hiked rates there has been little correlation among them. So, they have \\n\\nnot really been hiking in a lock-step fashion. And the correlation among short-dated EM rates is also not that \\n\\nstrong. \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nOne question we have been getting is whether higher volatility and stronger cross-asset correlations \\n\\nchallenge our view of favouring USD assets. But we think favouring US Treasuries, US equities, and the \\n\\nUSD is actually totally consistent in this context. We are looking through the 2020 horizon where, on our \\n\\nforecasts, the US economy will slow to below-potential growth and the Fed will start cutting rates. I’d be \\n\\nsurprised that even during a sell-off and a further pick-up in volatility people would flee from the USD. \\n\\n+30bp\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n60\\n\\n70\\n\\n80\\n\\n90\\n\\n100\\n\\nDec 17 Feb 18 Apr 18 Jun 18 Aug 18 Oct 18 Dec 18\\n\\nA\\nss\\n\\net\\n s\\n\\nw\\nap\\n\\n s\\np\\n\\nre\\nad\\n\\n (b\\np\\n\\n)\\n\\nPrevious end-18 forecast  \\n\\nCurrent end-18 forecast +45bp\\n\\nEUR IG\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdSjvvqx\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n \\nSteven Major \\n\\nAnd some view the story of a stronger USD and long US Treasuries as inconsistent, which I suppose comes \\n\\nfrom interest rate parity model type of thinking. But I think there is more to it. If we talk to our FX team, their \\n\\nsense is that the US is still quite well-positioned cyclically. But even if the US were to move to something \\n\\nquite nasty, the USD would also be benefitting. In fixed income, we are obviously more focusing on the latter \\n\\nscenario. And in our latest FIAA Look right through (3 October 2018), we are looking right to 2020 – and our \\n\\nforecasts are for rate cuts by the Fed. \\n\\n \\nDavid Bloom \\n\\nAs Steve alludes to, we currently see the USD continuing to outperform. As the Fed delivers on its “dots” in \\n\\nthe coming months, the positive cyclical story and levels of US short-end rates compared to its G10 \\n\\ncounterparts should continue to support a USD bull run. If we suppose that instead the US economy slows \\n\\nmaterially, forcing a possible policy reversal by the Fed, we would still argue that the USD would outperform. \\n\\nFirst, such a scenario would be risk-off in which the USD benefits, and second it is clear that after years of \\n\\ntightening, US policy is better placed to deal with a downturn than other G10 economies. Ultimately, we only \\n\\nsee the USD weakening in a ‘middle ground’ scenario where the Fed calls an early end to the tightening \\n\\ncycle and is comfortable that it has done enough to meet its twin mandate (see Currency Outlook: The \\n\\nrunning of the bulls, 13 September 2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nThanks all for your contributions. \\n\\n \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/vkpJLDX\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/FsJNLKS\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/FsJNLKS\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n15 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nDisclosure appendix \\n\\nAnalyst Certification \\n\\nThe following analyst(s), economist(s), or strategist(s) who is(are) primarily responsible for this report, including any analyst(s) \\n\\nwhose name(s) appear(s) as author of an individual section or sections of the report and any analyst(s) named as the covering \\n\\nanalyst(s) of a subsidiary company in a sum-of-the-parts valuation certifies(y) that the opinion(s) on the subject security(ies) or \\n\\nissuer(s), any views or forecasts expressed in the section(s) of which such individual(s) is(are) named as author(s), and any other \\n\\nviews or forecasts expressed herein, including any views expressed on the back page of the research report, accurately reflect \\n\\ntheir personal view(s) and that no part of their compensation was, is or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific \\n\\nrecommendation(s) or views contained in this research report: Pierre Blanchet, Steven Major, CFA, Mark McDonald, Dr. Murat \\n\\nUlgen, David Bloom, Subhrajit Banerjee, CFA, Andre de Silva, CFA, Fabio Balboni, Chris Attfield, Daniel Grosvenor, Max Kettner, \\n\\nRyan Wang, Lawrence Dyer and Ali Cakiroglu \\n\\nImportant disclosures \\n\\nEquities: Stock ratings and basis for financial analysis \\n\\nHSBC and its affiliates, including the issuer of this report (“HSBC”) believes an investor\\'s decision to buy or sell a stock should \\n\\ndepend on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s existing holdings, risk tolerance and other considerations and that \\n\\ninvestors utilise various disciplines and investment horizons when making investment decisions.

When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n16 \\n\\nbe classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a \\n\\nHold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between \\n\\n5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% \\n\\nbelow the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. \\n\\nOur ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any \\'material change\\' (initiation or resumption of coverage, change \\n\\nin target price or estimates).  \\n\\nUpside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. \\n\\nPrior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: \\n\\nFor each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropriate, \\n\\nregional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the \\n\\nstock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, \\n\\nthe potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the \\n\\nforecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 \\n\\nmonths (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was \\n\\nexpected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage \\n\\npoints for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. \\n\\n*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months \\n\\n(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, stocks which \\n\\nwe did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the past month\\'s \\n\\naverage of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, \\n\\nvolatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock\\'s status to change. \\n\\nRating distribution for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nAs of 24 October 2018, the distribution of all independent ratings published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n \\nFor the purposes of the distribution above the following mapping structure is used during the transition from the previous to current \\n\\nrating models: under our previous model, Overweight = Buy, Neutral = Hold and Underweight = Sell; under our current model Buy \\n\\n= Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.  For rating definitions under both models, please see “Stock ratings and basis for financial \\n\\nanalysis” above. \\n\\nDefinitions for fundamental credit and covered bond recommendations from 22 April 2016 \\n\\nOverweight: For corporate credit, the issuer’s fundamental credit profile is expected to improve over the next six months.

After the pick-up in EM \\n\\nvolatility earlier this year, vol now looks to be spilling over into DM. Our analysts \\n\\ndiscuss whether volatility has returned, alongside possible catalysts for sustaining \\n\\nhigher DM vol, including US mid-term elections and continuing Italian concerns. \\n\\nWe then discuss the implications of higher vol across asset classes. In rates, we note \\n\\nhow the pick-up in vol is more acute in long-dated vols than short-dated vols – a clear \\n\\ncontrast to the moves we saw in the February equity sell-off. In FX, the EUR is \\n\\ndisplaying higher realised vol than its G10 counterparts. Finally, in EM we expect \\n\\nfurther headwinds from tight financial conditions and trade protectionism to prevent \\n\\nvolatility from fading. In summary, we think that a new volatility wave is under way. \\n\\nPart II: RORO Resurgence \\n\\nCross-asset correlations are exhibiting a distinctly Risk On – Risk Off (RORO) profile. \\n\\nIt appears that the RORO paradigm acts as a muscle memory in periods where \\n\\nvolatility picks up and global equities sell off.  \\n\\nThis structure of cross-asset correlations fits well with our broad strategy view. We \\n\\nstill favour US equities over Europe and we remain cautious about EM given the \\n\\ncurrent environment. Meanwhile, we have a bearish credit outlook in Europe and \\n\\nAsia (neutral US), and maintain our bullish US Treasuries view – we look through to \\n\\n2020 when we expect Fed rate cuts. We continue to look for further USD \\n\\nappreciation as the Fed delivers on its dots for now, but would also expect the USD \\n\\nto gain if the US economy slows materially.

Mark is there evidence of a return of volatility? \\n\\n \\n\\nMark McDonald \\n\\nOur Cross-Asset Volatility Indicator (CRAVIN, Figure 1) is definitely not low anymore as it’s back in the \\n\\n25-75 percentile range, but it’s not at objectively high levels either. It does look like we have passed the \\n\\nlows in vol, particularly when you take this information in conjunction with our volatility wave analysis \\n\\n(Figure 2). A new volatility wave is building, and the volatility wave chart suggests that once volatility \\n\\npicks up in some asset classes, it typically spills over into others. \\n\\n Figure 1: Our Cross-asset Volatility Indicator (CRAVIN) \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n Figure 2: A new wave of Vol is starting to develop  \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nAt the start of this wave, increased vol was just an EM phenomenon. Now are you suggesting that \\n\\nvolatility is rising in DM, too? \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nYes – in August we highlighted this volatility divergence between EM and DM (see EM-DM vol \\n\\ndivergence, 8 August 2018). Back then, the EM vol premium was high, whereas the DM vol premium \\n\\nremained low, suggesting that the market was happy for this divergence to continue. That has now \\n\\nchanged. With the recent equity sell-off implied vols are definitely higher now across DM too, although \\n\\nthere is not enough data to know whether realised vol in DM has picked up. The sort of complacency in \\n\\nthe pricing of DM vols that we saw in the summer has gone. \\n\\n Figure 3: Implied volatilities of DM Equity and Rates have risen \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nI suppose the catalyst for sustaining higher vol. could be political uncertainties. Ryan, we have the \\n\\nUS mid-terms just around the corner. Could they become a source of volatility? \\n\\n \\n\\nRyan Wang \\n\\nThe outlook for the US mid-terms hasn’t changed considerably over the last month. It’s still \\n\\nanticipated from the polling data we have, that the Democrats will take control of the House of \\n\\nRepresentatives. The Senate is much less likely to switch control from its current Republican \\n\\nmajority (see US Midterm Elections, Divided Congress still possible, 22 October 2018).  \\n\\nIrrespective of the election results, it doesn’t look like the issue of trade protectionism will go away. \\n\\nThere is a scheduled increase in US tariffs to 25% from 10% on USD200bn of imports from China. If \\n\\nthat were to take effect at the start of next year, then investors might start to worry about the risk of a \\n\\nthird tranche of tariffs, potentially impacting all US imports from China. \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nIn Europe, although Brexit uncertainties might be close to an end, Italy puts the European Union in \\n\\nunchartered territories. Fabio, Chris, do you think Italy can remain a source of market volatility? \\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n60\\n\\n65\\n\\n70\\n\\n75\\n\\n80\\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\nJan-18 Feb-18 Mar-18 Apr-18 May-18 Jun-18 Jul-18 Aug-18 Sep-18 Oct-18\\n\\nEquity Implied Vol (percentage points, LHS) Rates Implied Vol (basis points, RHS)\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/VPjRvr2\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/VPjRvr2\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/N72wzQrjvvqx\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\n\\nFabio Balboni \\n\\nMoody\\'s downward revision of Italy’s sovereign rating but with a stable outlook was seen with some \\n\\nrelief by markets. But it changes very little of the overall outlook and risks. Last week the European \\n\\nCommission (EC) sent a letter to the Italian government noting the \"unprecedented\" divergence \\n\\nbetween the proposed deficit and the target agreed with the EU, effectively preparing the ground to \\n\\nbring Italy under the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). If the Italian government sticks to its \\n\\n2.4% of GDP deficit target – which so far it has said it will (La Repubblica, 22 October 2018) – then \\n\\nwe think the EC will have no option but to propose to bring Italy back under the EDP, to preserve its \\n\\ncredibility and avoid setting dangerous precedents. This could happen relatively quickly, even before \\n\\nthe end of the year (see Italy’s 2019 draft budget, 16 October 2018). Hence, there might still be more \\n\\n‘bad news’ for the market to digest in the next few weeks, creating some volatility, including the \\n\\npossibly of a downgrade by S&P on 26 October. \\n\\n \\n\\nChris Attfield \\n\\nIn a market where 30bp+ moves appear to be the ‘new normal’, forecasting is not about any \\n\\nmeasure of “fair value.” Even though a rating-based approach shows Italy is trading in deeply cheap \\n\\nterritory for an IG sovereign, we think this can easily continue in the medium term. For 2019, our \\n\\nbase case is still that a systemic crisis will be averted, and that redenomination risk will not be priced \\n\\ninto the market to any significant degree. Therefore, a level of 200bp by the end of next year seems \\n\\nreasonable: it may be optimistic, but we think 300bp is too wide for an equilibrium to be reached. \\n\\nAlthough Italian risks remain a concern, we note value in the short end of Spain as it has displayed \\n\\nlow volatility to BTPs in 2018 and relatively attractive carry (see The proper pricing of policy, 19 \\n\\nOctober 2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nLet’s talk about the implications across the asset classes. Subhrajit, do we see changes in the vol \\n\\ndynamic of rates markets? Is it different from what we’d seen in February this year? \\n\\n \\n\\nSubhrajit Banerjee \\n\\nWe can definitely see that rates vol has picked up in certain segments of the bond market. This is \\n\\nespecially notable with the EUR interest rate vol, which was quite low to begin with. An interesting \\n\\nphenomena is occurring when you compare short-dated vol. with long-dated vol, especially in the USD \\n\\nrates market. In February, when we saw a similar volatility pick-up, it was much more pronounced in \\n\\nshort-dated vol. versus long-dated vol. – a move stemming from uncertainty over monetary policy \\n\\nexpectations. This time, however, we are seeing a more aggressive pick-up in long-dated vols. This is \\n\\nan interesting development and something we will watch closely as it shows the rates vol. dynamic has \\n\\nchanged. \\n\\n \\n\\nSteven Major \\n\\nThis temporary move in the curve is getting a lot of attention. Are these moves mostly confined to real \\n\\nrates and its volatility? \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/Z6gthRvPjDIr\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/VpjL7FLxchvm\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nSubhrajit Banerjee \\n\\nYes. When we look at long-dated interest rate vol this can be split into two categories. One is real yield \\n\\nvol. and another one is inflation risk premia. Recently, the inflation risk premia has remained calm while \\n\\nvolatility is seen more on the real yield front. Adjustments happen on real yields, which begs the \\n\\nquestion about the uncertainty about the level of R*. \\n\\n Figure 4 : Vol seen to have increased mostly via the real yield channel \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n* Realised vol calculated using trailing 6m window \\n \\n\\n \\nSteven Major \\n\\nThe point we’d make more broadly is that the longer-term forward rates are barely above the Fed’s \\n\\nsupposed equilibrium rate. Larry, do you have anything to add on this? \\n\\n \\n\\nLawrence Dyer \\n\\nWe would expect a consolidation given the historical pattern – the high 5Y5Y forward rate (3.35%) \\n\\nsuggest the market is already pricing in the Fed’s tightening plans. So unless you anticipate that the \\n\\nFed could move its funds rate up towards 3.75% or more, there is little reason to expect long rates to \\n\\npush much higher. The distribution of the longer-run funds rate in the dot plot suggests the FOMC sees \\n\\nthe risks as biased to lower rate. One dot is at 3.5%, the other fifteen dots are below the current 5Y5Y \\n\\nforward. There are seven at 2.75% or less, and eight if you consider that one member refuses to even \\n\\nguess the longer-run rate, but has a 2.125% rate in 2021. \\n\\n \\n\\nMax Kettner \\n\\nFrom a multi-asset perspective, if real yields continue to rise and volatility picks up further, then that \\n\\nusually has implications for credit and equity. Although there is considerable uncertainty around the \\n\\nrelationship between real yields and equity multiples, a level of 10-year real yields of c1.5% was \\n\\nconsistent with equity multiples no longer expanding. Credit IG is more exposed to rates vol and HY is \\n\\nmore exposed to equity vol. So rising rates and equity volatility can negatively impact the risk profile of \\n\\nUSD credit, and probably EUR credit.  \\n\\n0.6\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.8\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n1.3\\n\\n1.4\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n60\\n\\n70\\n\\n80\\n\\n90\\n\\n100\\n\\nDec-15 Jun-16 Dec-16 Jun-17 Dec-17 Jun-18\\n\\nV\\no\\n\\nl r\\nat\\n\\nio\\n\\nR\\nea\\n\\nlis\\ned\\n\\n V\\no\\n\\nl *\\n  (\\n\\nb\\np\\n\\n)\\n\\nUSD 5y5y real yield vol USD 5y5y inflation swap vol Vol ratio (RHS)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n Figure 5 : A further rise in real yields may not support equity multiples \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nMark, you wrote that EUR FX volatility has a different dynamic to the rest of G10 FX. \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nFor most G10 currency pairs, realised vol is still at the low end of its previous six-month range. Yet for \\n\\nalmost all EUR crosses, realised vol is at the high end of its six-month range (see Data Matters: RORO \\n\\nResurgence, 17 October 2018). For example, we see EUR-JPY vol is high, but USD-JPY vol is low. \\n\\nClearly, this needs an EUR-specific explanation.  \\n\\nWe believe such behaviour might be due to worries about Italy, and to some extent Turkey. When \\n\\nTurkey was selling off, there were worries about contagion to the European banking system and, \\n\\nhence, European assets came under pressure. These are the sort of linkages that display the ways \\n\\nthat volatility can spill from one asset class to another. \\n\\n-5\\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12\\n\\nC\\nA\\n\\nP\\nE\\n\\nReal 10-year US Treasury yield (using CPI)\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdS\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdS\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n Figure 6: Most EUR crosses display higher vol \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, emerging markets have initiated a vol dynamic. David, is there risk surrounding \\n\\ngreater volatility in USD-RMB? \\n\\n \\n\\nDavid Bloom \\n\\nEffectively we are seeing USD-RMB weakening, but not necessarily with a spike in volatility. Instead \\n\\nwe have seen and continue to expect a gradual depreciation of the RMB over time. As such, we are \\n\\nforecasting USD-CNY at 7.10 by end-2019. But that gradual process would not substantially increase \\n\\nvolatility. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n \\n\\nMurat Ulgen \\n\\nFrom a top-down EM perspective, the key issues are trade protectionism, slowing growth, and \\n\\ntightening financial conditions. But coming back to the previous discussion about rising real rates – \\n\\nboth on the level and volatility – this has been an issue in so far that the real rate gap between EM and \\n\\nthe US is narrowing. Consequently, the re-pricing of risk premium in emerging markets may not be \\n\\nover. A narrowing gap will continue to be a drag on EM in the background. \\n\\n \\n\\nAndre De Silva \\n\\nThe real yield differential between EM and DM has indeed narrowed, but it is still sizeable. Moreover, if \\n\\none decomposes the individual countries this indicates more dispersion. The real yield bond valuations \\n\\nin Indonesia are quite generous in light of policy tightening during a period of subdued inflation. In \\n\\ncontrast, the surge in inflation in Turkey has put real yields in negative territory.  \\n\\nFor emerging market bonds, one key source of volatility has been EM FX and reflects a key \\n\\ncomponent of tightening of financial conditions that Murat Ulgen referred to earlier. Prior to September, \\n\\nEM FX had lost nearly 20% year-to-date. Since then we have seen these currencies stabilise or even \\n\\nbounce back somewhat. The main issues of Fed tightening and US-China trade tensions remain, but \\n\\nthese factors are well known. The policy adjustment from several EM countries is also starting to bite, \\n\\nranging from 150bp rate hikes from Indonesia, the second round of accelerated IMF funding for \\n\\nArgentina, and Russia surprising the markets with a rate hike and a sprinkling of other measures to \\n\\nrestrict imports and stem price pressures. One sign of a reassessment of EM bonds, even if FX risks \\n\\nremain, is the re-tightening of EM external debt spreads since the peak of above 400bp in the JPM \\n\\nEMBI during early September vs c300bp earlier this year.       \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nThanks Andre. We’ve seen some positive stories in EM. In Brazil, expectations about the election \\n\\ndelivering a market-friendly outcome has seen the BRL rally. In Turkey, the narrowing of the geo-\\n\\npolitical risk premium and a C/A surplus has seen the TRY rally.  \\n\\nMurat, could this be enough for EM volatility to fall and EM FX vols to settle down? \\n\\n \\nMurat Ulgen \\n\\nNo, not necessarily. I would still consider tightening financial conditions and trade protectionism as \\n\\nsecular dynamica in the background negatively impacting EM sentiment and therefore volatility. As \\n\\nRyan mentioned earlier, it doesn’t look like any of these factors will go away anytime soon. There is a \\n\\nG20 summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November. Unless there is a breakthrough on the ongoing \\n\\nUS-China trade disputes at this summit, it seems trade protectionism issues will likely linger into 2019. \\n\\nGiven the Fed’s trajectory, many EM economies with C/A deficits are seeing capital being withdrawn. \\n\\nHence, to stem the tide these countries have to raise interest rates – so further tightening financial \\n\\nconditions as we have already seen in 2Q18 and 3Q18. \\n\\nBoth issues not only present downside risk to EM growth but in certain countries upside risks to \\n\\ninflation as well (see GEMS Investor, 7 October 2018). \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/PdZRCSQ\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n9 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\n\\nAli Cakiroglu \\n\\nJust to add on EM growth – the consensus forecast is for 5% GDP growth in EM during 2019.

Where do we stand in terms of cross-asset correlations? Has \\n\\nthere been any significant shift during the recent sell-off? \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nIn the last edition of Data Matters (17 October 2018), we highlighted the resurgence of the classic Risk On / \\n\\nRisk Off pattern. The typical RORO correlation profile is positive correlations among risk-on assets, positive \\n\\ncorrelations among risk-off assets and, critically, a negative correlation between these two asset blocks. \\n\\nAlthough the overall level of correlations is nowhere near the extreme levels such as in 2012, that profile of \\n\\ncross asset correlations has come back.  \\n\\nWe’ve been highlighting for a while that we see signs of the RORO factor lurking in the background of cross-\\n\\nasset returns. What’s changed is that we now see a ‘RORO-esque’ heat map. Cross-asset correlations \\n\\nbegan to rise in August, so it’s not purely driven by the recent equity market sell-off. Interestingly, many \\n\\npeople are blaming higher yields for the sell-off in equities, which would suggest a positive correlation \\n\\nbetween bond and equity returns. However, there is still a negative correlation between the two. So while \\n\\nhigher yields are likely to be an important driver of the equity sell-off, this suggests to us that there have also \\n\\nbeen other drivers at work. Looking for a single factor that explains the equity sell-off is overly simplistic \\n\\nhere. \\n\\n Figure 9: Our RORO index has increased since August \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nFrom a multi-asset perspective, the issue is that when assets lose their specific identities, asset allocators \\n\\nfind it much more difficult to express specific views or themes to find effective diversification. Can you \\n\\nremind us what it was like when correlations were at their extremes? \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdSjvvqx\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nBack in 2012 most assets lost much of their individual character. Assets partitioned themselves into either a \\n\\nrisk-on or a risk-off bucket and the majority of their price action was explained by the common factor. This \\n\\ncaused significant problems for asset managers – there was little benefit to being an asset class expert \\n\\nduring this time since the overwhelming influence on the resulting P&L was the change in overall risk \\n\\nsentiment.  \\n\\nNow, clearly the correlations we’re seeing at the moment are nowhere near those levels. But the presence \\n\\nof this correlation structure coming back during a challenging time for markets does suggest that we may \\n\\nhave what I call a kind of ‘muscle memory’ in markets. Investors simply switch back to these risk on / risk off \\n\\nbehaviours at times of stress. \\n\\n Figure 10: Once again we see two clear blocks of assets: risk-on assets, and ‘safe havens’ \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nDaniel Grosvenor \\n\\nFor equities, I think it is interesting that the relationship between the typical ‘bond proxy’ sectors and the \\n\\ndevelopment of rates seems to have broken down (see Global Equity Insights: Shaken but not stirred, 11 \\n\\nOctober 2018). Normally when bond yields rise these sectors tend to sell-off as well. But they have \\n\\nactually been quite resilient over the past month or so. I think this reflects their defensive nature and \\n\\nsuggests that investors are worried about the outlook for growth, consequently favouring these sectors. \\n\\nHaving underperformed for most of the past two years, defensives are now outperforming again. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n Figure 11 : Breaking down the bond-equity correlation \\n\\n \\nSource: Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nSo you think global equity markets are already transitioning to this new paradigm? \\n\\n \\nDaniel Grosvenor \\n\\nIn our Global Equity Strategy Quarterly, we wrote about the risk from a rise in volatility, particularly in DM, \\n\\nand the pressure this could have on valuations (see Global Equity Strategy: Extend and defend, 1 October \\n\\n2018). And I think this has already partly played out. The global 12m forward PE ratio has fallen to just \\n\\n14.2x. In January, it was almost 17x, and the long-term average is 15.8x. So valuations have already \\n\\ncorrected significantly.  \\n\\nThe issue is that these valuation multiples are underpinned by relatively strong consensus growth \\n\\nexpectations. If you get disappointment there, then of course equities don’t appear as cheap anymore. \\n\\nThis leads us to our preference for the US, as we are comfortable with the US earnings outlook where \\n\\nexpectations are for c10% EPS growth in 2019. We are more concerned elsewhere, and particularly in \\n\\nEurope where we see further downward revisions.  It is difficult to see what drives a reacceleration in \\n\\nEuropean earnings momentum from here (see European Equity Insights: Still waiting for a growth spurt, \\n\\n17 September 2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nThanks Dan. Steve is this an inflexion point? \\n\\n \\nSteven Major \\n\\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect about an inflexion point is that this does not necessarily tell us anything \\n\\nabout the future direction. It’s a turning point and we could simply go back to the old regime – we are simply \\n\\nnot meant to know until afterwards. If we’ve learned anything about the past ten years of QE and excess \\n\\ndebt is that traditional wisdom does not necessarily apply any longer.

The ingredients of higher \\n\\nUS Treasury yields, stronger dollar and tighter dollar financial conditions would in the past typically impact \\n\\nLatAm the most, especially Brazil and Mexico. However, this time around it’s driven much more by \\n\\nidiosyncratic stories. In Brazil, this has to do with elections and hopes for more market-friendly policies. In \\n\\nMexico, there is still the NAFTA risk being reduced. In contrast, Asia has very recently borne more the brunt \\n\\nof higher volatility. Perhaps this also has to do with the rise in oil prices, which Asia is much more exposed \\n\\nto, particularly India and to a certain degree also Indonesia. In China, concerns still linger about the trade \\n\\nconflict. So we think fundamentally there is a good reason why we have seen this shift of ‘old’ correlation \\n\\npatterns. \\n\\n \\nSubhrajit Banerjee \\n\\nWe’ve found similar dynamics in Data Matters (17 October 2018), for example in short-dated EM rates. \\n\\nAlthough most central banks have hiked rates there has been little correlation among them. So, they have \\n\\nnot really been hiking in a lock-step fashion. And the correlation among short-dated EM rates is also not that \\n\\nstrong. \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nOne question we have been getting is whether higher volatility and stronger cross-asset correlations \\n\\nchallenge our view of favouring USD assets. But we think favouring US Treasuries, US equities, and the \\n\\nUSD is actually totally consistent in this context. We are looking through the 2020 horizon where, on our \\n\\nforecasts, the US economy will slow to below-potential growth and the Fed will start cutting rates. I’d be \\n\\nsurprised that even during a sell-off and a further pick-up in volatility people would flee from the USD. \\n\\n+30bp\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n60\\n\\n70\\n\\n80\\n\\n90\\n\\n100\\n\\nDec 17 Feb 18 Apr 18 Jun 18 Aug 18 Oct 18 Dec 18\\n\\nA\\nss\\n\\net\\n s\\n\\nw\\nap\\n\\n s\\np\\n\\nre\\nad\\n\\n (b\\np\\n\\n)\\n\\nPrevious end-18 forecast  \\n\\nCurrent end-18 forecast +45bp\\n\\nEUR IG\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdSjvvqx\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n \\nSteven Major \\n\\nAnd some view the story of a stronger USD and long US Treasuries as inconsistent, which I suppose comes \\n\\nfrom interest rate parity model type of thinking. But I think there is more to it. If we talk to our FX team, their \\n\\nsense is that the US is still quite well-positioned cyclically. But even if the US were to move to something \\n\\nquite nasty, the USD would also be benefitting. In fixed income, we are obviously more focusing on the latter \\n\\nscenario. And in our latest FIAA Look right through (3 October 2018), we are looking right to 2020 – and our \\n\\nforecasts are for rate cuts by the Fed. \\n\\n \\nDavid Bloom \\n\\nAs Steve alludes to, we currently see the USD continuing to outperform. As the Fed delivers on its “dots” in \\n\\nthe coming months, the positive cyclical story and levels of US short-end rates compared to its G10 \\n\\ncounterparts should continue to support a USD bull run. If we suppose that instead the US economy slows \\n\\nmaterially, forcing a possible policy reversal by the Fed, we would still argue that the USD would outperform. \\n\\nFirst, such a scenario would be risk-off in which the USD benefits, and second it is clear that after years of \\n\\ntightening, US policy is better placed to deal with a downturn than other G10 economies. Ultimately, we only \\n\\nsee the USD weakening in a ‘middle ground’ scenario where the Fed calls an early end to the tightening \\n\\ncycle and is comfortable that it has done enough to meet its twin mandate (see Currency Outlook: The \\n\\nrunning of the bulls, 13 September 2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nThanks all for your contributions. \\n\\n \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/vkpJLDX\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/FsJNLKS\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/FsJNLKS\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n15 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nDisclosure appendix \\n\\nAnalyst Certification \\n\\nThe following analyst(s), economist(s), or strategist(s) who is(are) primarily responsible for this report, including any analyst(s) \\n\\nwhose name(s) appear(s) as author of an individual section or sections of the report and any analyst(s) named as the covering \\n\\nanalyst(s) of a subsidiary company in a sum-of-the-parts valuation certifies(y) that the opinion(s) on the subject security(ies) or \\n\\nissuer(s), any views or forecasts expressed in the section(s) of which such individual(s) is(are) named as author(s), and any other \\n\\nviews or forecasts expressed herein, including any views expressed on the back page of the research report, accurately reflect \\n\\ntheir personal view(s) and that no part of their compensation was, is or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific \\n\\nrecommendation(s) or views contained in this research report: Pierre Blanchet, Steven Major, CFA, Mark McDonald, Dr. Murat \\n\\nUlgen, David Bloom, Subhrajit Banerjee, CFA, Andre de Silva, CFA, Fabio Balboni, Chris Attfield, Daniel Grosvenor, Max Kettner, \\n\\nRyan Wang, Lawrence Dyer and Ali Cakiroglu \\n\\nImportant disclosures \\n\\nEquities: Stock ratings and basis for financial analysis \\n\\nHSBC and its affiliates, including the issuer of this report (“HSBC”) believes an investor\\'s decision to buy or sell a stock should \\n\\ndepend on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s existing holdings, risk tolerance and other considerations and that \\n\\ninvestors utilise various disciplines and investment horizons when making investment decisions.

Different securities firms use a variety of ratings terms as well as different rating \\n\\nsystems to describe their recommendations and therefore investors should carefully read the definitions of the ratings used in \\n\\neach research report. Further, investors should carefully read the entire research report and not infer its contents from the rating \\n\\nbecause research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts\\' views and the basis for the rating. \\n\\nFixed income: Basis for financial analysis \\n\\nThis report is designed for, and should only be utilised by, institutional investors.  Furthermore, HSBC believes an investor\\'s \\n\\ndecision to make an investment should depend on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s existing holdings and other \\n\\nconsiderations. \\n\\nHSBC believes that investors utilise various disciplines and investment horizons when making investment decisions, which \\n\\ndepend largely on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s existing holdings, risk tolerance and other considerations. Given \\n\\nthese differences, HSBC has three principal aims in its fixed income research: 1) to identify long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nbased on particular themes or ideas that may affect the future earnings or cash flows of companies in corporate credit and based \\n\\non country-specific ideas or themes that may affect the performance of these bonds in the case of covered bonds, in both cases \\n\\non a six-month time horizon; 2) to identify trade ideas on a time horizon of up to three months, relating to specific instruments and \\n\\nsegments of the yield curve, which are predominantly derived from relative value considerations or driven by events and which \\n\\nmay differ from our long-term credit opinion on an issuer. Buy or Sell refer to a trade call to buy or sell that given instrument; 3) to \\n\\nexpress views on the likely future performance of sectors, benchmark indices or markets in our fixed income strategy products. \\n\\nHSBC has assigned a fundamental recommendation structure, as described below, only for its long-term investment opportunities. \\n\\nHSBC believes an investor\\'s decision to buy or sell a bond should depend on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s \\n\\nexisting holdings and other considerations. Different securities firms use a variety of terms as well as different systems to describe \\n\\ntheir recommendations. Investors should carefully read the definitions of the recommendations used in each research report. In \\n\\naddition, because research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts\\' views, investors should carefully \\n\\nread the entire research report and should not infer its contents from the recommendation. In any case, recommendations should \\n\\nnot be used or relied on in isolation as investment advice. \\n\\nHSBC Global Research is not and does not hold itself out to be a Credit Rating Agency as defined under the Hong Kong Securities \\n\\nand Futures Ordinance. \\n\\nFrom 23rd March 2015 HSBC has assigned ratings on the following basis: \\n\\nThe target price is based on the analyst’s assessment of the stock’s actual current value, although we expect it to take six to 12 \\n\\nmonths for the market price to reflect this.  When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n16 \\n\\nbe classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a \\n\\nHold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between \\n\\n5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% \\n\\nbelow the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. \\n\\nOur ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any \\'material change\\' (initiation or resumption of coverage, change \\n\\nin target price or estimates).  \\n\\nUpside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. \\n\\nPrior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: \\n\\nFor each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropriate, \\n\\nregional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the \\n\\nstock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, \\n\\nthe potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the \\n\\nforecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 \\n\\nmonths (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was \\n\\nexpected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage \\n\\npoints for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. \\n\\n*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months \\n\\n(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, stocks which \\n\\nwe did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the past month\\'s \\n\\naverage of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, \\n\\nvolatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock\\'s status to change. \\n\\nRating distribution for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nAs of 24 October 2018, the distribution of all independent ratings published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n \\nFor the purposes of the distribution above the following mapping structure is used during the transition from the previous to current \\n\\nrating models: under our previous model, Overweight = Buy, Neutral = Hold and Underweight = Sell; under our current model Buy \\n\\n= Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.  For rating definitions under both models, please see “Stock ratings and basis for financial \\n\\nanalysis” above. \\n\\nDefinitions for fundamental credit and covered bond recommendations from 22 April 2016 \\n\\nOverweight: For corporate credit, the issuer’s fundamental credit profile is expected to improve over the next six months.  For \\n\\ncovered bonds, the bonds issued in this country are expected to outperform those of the other countries in our coverage over the \\n\\nnext six months. \\n\\nNeutral: For corporate credit, the issuer’s fundamental credit profile is expected to remain stable over the next six months.  For \\n\\ncovered bonds, the bonds issued in this country are expected to perform in line with those of the other countries in our coverage \\n\\nover the next six months. \\n\\nUnderweight: For corporate credit, the issuer’s fundamental credit profile is expected to deteriorate over the next six months.  \\n\\nFor covered bonds, the bonds issued in this country are expected to underperform those of other countries in our coverage over \\n\\nthe next six months. \\n\\nPrior to this date, fundamental recommendations for corporate credit were applied on the following basis: \\n\\nOverweight: The credits of the issuer were expected to outperform those of other issuers in the sector over the next six months. \\n\\nNeutral: The credits of the issuer were expected to perform in line with those of other issuers in the sector over the next six \\n\\nmonths. \\n\\nBuy 53% ( 33% of these provided with Investment Banking Services ) \\n\\nHold 37% ( 31% of these provided with Investment Banking Services ) \\n\\nSell 10% ( 20% of these provided with Investment Banking Services ) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n17 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nUnderweight: The credits of the issuer were expected to underperform those of other issuers in the sector over the next six \\n\\nmonths. \\n\\nDistribution of fundamental credit and covered bond recommendations \\n\\nAs of 23 October 2018, the distribution of all independent fundamental credit recommendations published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n All Covered issuers Issuers to whom HSBC has provided Investment Banking in the past 12 months \\n\\n Count Percentage Count Percentage \\n\\nOverweight 97 24 45 46 \\nNeutral 223 55 103 46 \\nUnderweight 84 21 18 21 \\n\\nSource: HSBC     \\n\\nFor the distribution of non-independent ratings published by HSBC, please see the disclosure page available at \\n\\nhttp://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/financial-regulation/investment-recommendations-disclosures. \\n\\nRecommendation changes for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nTo view a list of all the independent fundamental ratings disseminated by HSBC during the preceding 12-month period, please \\n\\nuse the following links to access the disclosure page: \\n\\nClients of Global Research and Global Banking and Markets: www.research.hsbc.com/A/Disclosures \\n\\nClients of HSBC Private Banking: www.research.privatebank.hsbc.com/Disclosures \\n\\nHSBC and its affiliates will from time to time sell to and buy from customers the securities/instruments, both equity and debt \\n\\n(including derivatives) of companies covered in HSBC Research on a principal or agency basis or act as a market maker or \\n\\nliquidity provider in the securities/instruments mentioned in this report. \\n\\nAnalysts, economists, and strategists are paid in part by reference to the profitability of HSBC which includes investment banking, \\n\\nsales & trading, and principal trading revenues.  \\n\\nWhether, or in what time frame, an update of this analysis will be published is not determined in advance. \\n\\nNon-U.S. analysts may not be associated persons of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc, and therefore may not be subject to FINRA \\n\\nRule 2241 or FINRA Rule 2242 restrictions on communications with the subject company, public appearances and trading \\n\\nsecurities held by the analysts.  \\n\\nEconomic sanctions imposed by the EU and OFAC prohibit transacting or dealing in new debt or equity of Russian SSI entities. \\n\\nThis report does not constitute advice in relation to any securities issued by Russian SSI entities on or after July 16 2014 and as \\n\\nsuch, this report should not be construed as an inducement to transact in any sanctioned securities. \\n\\nFor disclosures in respect of any company mentioned in this report, please see the most recently published report on that company \\n\\navailable at www.hsbcnet.com/research.
