However, excluding the impact of recently acquired \\n\\nNigerian operations and one-off impact of devaluation of the Sudanese Pound, revenues \\n\\nfrom core operations in Egypt were up 28% while margins were up 3pp to 44.2%.  \\n\\nStrong growth in walk-ins to continue supporting growth & margins: During the first \\n\\nhalf, IDH reported 13% growth in tests done by walk-in patients compared to just 2% \\n\\ngrowth in tests done by contract patients. It is worth highlighting that revenue per test in \\n\\nthe case of walk-in patients is more than double of contract patients hence drives stronger \\n\\nmargins. Over the last few years, a structural shift had driven increasing share of contract \\n\\npatients at IDH due to weak macroeconomic conditions in Egypt and with more \\n\\ncorporates opting to provide employees with health benefits. With the improving economy \\n\\nand IDH’s focused marketing efforts, we would expect some walk-in patients to return \\n\\nwhich could provide support to group margins.      \\n\\nStrong margin gains in Egypt support our investment thesis: In our initiation report, \\n\\nEgyptian Healthcare, 2 July 2018, we had pointed out that IDH can generate further \\n\\nmargin gains once test volumes start to pick up. The key costs for IDH are chemicals for \\n\\nlab tests (at 18% of sales) and employee costs (at 8% of sales). We see scope for more \\n\\ntest per employee at IDH, especially as number of employees in central labs need not rise \\n\\nmuch to handle more tests. Hence, we believe that this operating leverage provides \\n\\nsupport to group margins.   \\n\\nEntry into Egyptian radiology although small, is positive: As of 2017 end, IDH had a \\n\\nnet cash position of EGP685m. We believe that the recent investments in Nigeria and \\n\\nplans to enter radiology in Egypt (announced on 14 Aug 2018) are moves that will put this \\n\\nexcess cash to good use. IDH will invest EGP186m over the next few years. Our \\n\\ncalculations indicate that such an investment would support setting up around ten new \\n\\nradiology labs as they are much more capex heavy compared to IDH’s usual pathology \\n\\nlabs. We estimate these labs to generate similar margins as pathology labs in long term.  \\n\\nMaintain target price of USD5.60 and Buy rating: IDH trades at 2019e P/E of 20.7x in-\\n\\nline with global diagnostic peers, but despite the new investments, IDH has an earnings \\n\\nCAGR of 22% between 2017 and 2020e stronger than global peers at 13% implying a \\n\\ndiscount of 40% in terms of PEG ratio. Furthermore, we see stronger long term growth for \\n\\nIDH due to the group’s presence in nascent markets and hence believe that such a \\n\\ndiscount is unwarranted. Key downside risk is depreciation of EGP as a significant share \\n\\nof the group’s chemical supplies are priced in USD. \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\n \\nMAINTAIN BUY \\n\\nTARGET PRICE (USD) PREVIOUS

\\n\\nAlthough IDH’s current investment plan into radiology is just EGP186m, which as per our \\n\\ncalculations could imply that the company may open around ten labs in the medium term, we \\n\\nsee strong potential for the group in this space.  \\n\\n\\uf034 Firstly, there is significant lack of supply in terms of radiology equipment in Egypt compared \\nwith even other emerging markets, which means that capacity utilisation is not going to be \\n\\nan issue for IDH.  \\n\\n\\uf034 Secondly, the market is quite fragmented, with market leaders like Cairo Scan (Not listed) \\nand TechoScan (Not listed) having just 16 and 20 labs respectively.  \\n\\n\\uf034 Thirdly, and from a longer term perspective, there is a significant lack of tertiary care \\ncapacity among Egyptian hospitals, especially in government facilities (please see our \\n\\ninitiation note Egyptian Healthcare, 2 July 2018 for more details). Most of the radiology \\n\\ndiagnostic equipment is capex heavy and hence mostly restricted to tertiary care hospitals \\n\\nor exclusive diagnostic labs like the one IDH plans to open.  \\n\\nBased on these factors we believe that long term growth potential in this space for IDH looks pretty \\n\\nstrong. Although, radiology labs is quite capex heavy compared to pathology labs, per lab \\n\\nrevenues at radiology are much stronger compared to pathology. Furthermore, we see similar \\n\\nmargin trends in both. In terms of sensitivity to EGP’s movement against USD, we believe that \\n\\nradiology labs are better placed compared to pathology labs as the share of cost of chemicals and \\n\\nregents (which are generally imported in Egypt) used in the case of radiology is relatively lower.        \\n\\n \\nEgyptian hospitals – public versus private (2016) \\n\\n \\nBasic health \\ncentres General hospitals \\n\\nSpecialised medical \\ncentres Universities Armed forces hospitals Private hospitals \\n\\nLevel of care Primary care - \\nmostly common \\ndiseases and \\ndiagnostics \\n\\nMostly primary care with \\nsome higher complexity \\ncases.

We estimate the group to \\n\\nstart operations of radiology labs from 2019 which drives the stronger revenue estimates for the \\n\\ngroup for 2019 and 2020. However, we cut our 2019 and 2020 margin estimates as we believe \\n\\nthat the new investments will lead to some margin pressure for the group. The increase in our \\n\\nnet income estimate for 2018 is driven by lower minority out flow we now estimate following the \\n\\ntrend we see in H1 18.  \\n\\nValuation and risks \\n\\nWe value IDH using a DCF methodology. For our DCF we now assume a risk-free rate of 3.0% \\n\\n(from 2.5%) in line with our Equity strategy team’s latest assumptions and a long-term inflation \\n\\ndifferential of 7.0% (vs 7.5% earlier) due to the higher risk-free rate. We use an equity risk \\n\\npremium of 8.0% (unchanged) and a beta of 0.6 for IDH, which leads to a cost of equity of \\n\\n14.8% (unchanged). We assume cost of debt at 10% and debt to equity at 70:30. These \\n\\nassumptions lead to a WACC of 12.5% (all unchanged).  \\n\\nOur DCF valuation produces a value of EGP100 per share (unchanged). The changes to our \\n\\nestimates are small and hence do not have a material impact on our target price. Using the spot \\n\\nEGP-USD FX rate of 17.90 (up from 17.80), we arrive at a USD-based target price of USD5.60 \\n\\n(unchanged). Our target price implies 31.8% upside from the current share price and a 2019e \\n\\nPE of 27.2x. Hence, we maintain our Buy rating on IDH. \\n\\nKey downside risks include 1) depreciation of EGP as a significant share of group’s chemical \\n\\nsupplies are priced in USD 2) integration issues with the recently acquired Nigerian operations \\n\\n3) slower than expected ramp-up in newly planned radiology division.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITIES ● HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS & SRVCS \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\n6 \\n\\nDisclosure appendix \\n\\nAnalyst Certification \\n\\nThe following analyst(s), economist(s), or strategist(s) who is(are) primarily responsible for this report, including any analyst(s) \\n\\nwhose name(s) appear(s) as author of an individual section or sections of the report and any analyst(s) named as the covering \\n\\nanalyst(s) of a subsidiary company in a sum-of-the-parts valuation certifies(y) that the opinion(s) on the subject security(ies) or \\n\\nissuer(s), any views or forecasts expressed in the section(s) of which such individual(s) is(are) named as author(s), and any other \\n\\nviews or forecasts expressed herein, including any views expressed on the back page of the research report, accurately reflect \\n\\ntheir personal view(s) and that no part of their compensation was, is or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific \\n\\nrecommendation(s) or views contained in this research report: Shankar P and Raj Sinha \\n\\nImportant disclosures \\n\\nEquities: Stock ratings and basis for financial analysis \\n\\nHSBC and its affiliates, including the issuer of this report (“HSBC”) believes an investor\\'s decision to buy or sell a stock should \\n\\ndepend on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s existing holdings, risk tolerance and other considerations and that \\n\\ninvestors utilise various disciplines and investment horizons when making investment decisions. Ratings should not be used or \\n\\nrelied on in isolation as investment advice. Different securities firms use a variety of ratings terms as well as different rating \\n\\nsystems to describe their recommendations and therefore investors should carefully read the definitions of the ratings used in \\n\\neach research report. Further, investors should carefully read the entire research report and not infer its contents from the rating \\n\\nbecause research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts\\' views and the basis for the rating. \\n\\nFrom 23rd March 2015 HSBC has assigned ratings on the following basis: \\n\\nThe target price is based on the analyst’s assessment of the stock’s actual current value, although we expect it to take six to 12 \\n\\nmonths for the market price to reflect this.  When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will \\n\\nbe classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a \\n\\nHold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between \\n\\n5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% \\n\\nbelow the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. \\n\\nOur ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any \\'material change\\' (initiation or resumption of coverage, change \\n\\nin target price or estimates).  \\n\\nUpside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. \\n\\nPrior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: \\n\\nFor each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropria te, \\n\\nregional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the \\n\\nstock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, \\n\\nthe potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the \\n\\nforecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 \\n\\nmonths (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was \\n\\nexpected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage \\n\\npoints for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. \\n\\n*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months \\n\\n(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, stocks which \\n\\nwe did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the past month\\'s \\n\\naverage of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, \\n\\nvolatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock\\'s status to change. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nEQUITIES ● HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS & SRVCS \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\nRating distribution for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nAs of 17 August 2018, the distribution of all independent ratings published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n \\nFor the purposes of the distribution above the following mapping structure is used during the transition from the previous to current \\n\\nrating models: under our previous model, Overweight = Buy, Neutral = Hold and Underweight = Sell; under our current model Buy \\n\\n= Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.

The recent share price slump of around 20% is overdone, in our view: it \\n\\nrepresents in our assessment a combination of fears around the Italian budget, a \\n\\ngeneral market sell-off and exxcessively high fears about the FDA’s approval for \\n\\nBose’s hearing aid. To put the latter in context, Amplifon’s US EBIT accounts for only \\n\\naround 17% of group EBIT, ie less than the recent fall in the share price.  \\n\\nBose/OTC concerns are overdone: We believe concerns around the 5 October \\n\\nFDA approval of Bose’s world’s first self-fitting hearing device are overdone. Yes, \\n\\nBose has very high brand recognition, is known for its high quality devices, and the \\n\\napproval represents the entry of a new player into the oligopolistic hearing aid \\n\\nmarket. However, we do not expect any impact on AMP’s P&L in the medium term. \\n\\nAs it is not an OTC device, Bose’s hearing aid will have to be sold via audiologists. \\n\\nThis is a significant hurdle, in our view, as audiologists have no experience with the \\n\\ndevice. Moreover, the timing of Bose’s market launch is uncertain and there is very \\n\\nlittle known about the device itself as yet. Lastly, the device is likely to target buyers \\n\\nwith mild hearing loss, ie they are likely to be younger than AMP’s typical customer. \\n\\nThis is an underpenetrated market and could even lead to incremental sales and little \\n\\ncannibalisation for Amplifon if it also decided to sell OTC devices. Note, however, \\n\\nthat the FDA will not publish its OTC specifications until August 2020 \\n\\nQ3 results on 30 October should restore confidence: We expect strong sales \\n\\ngrowth of 8% y-o-y (9% at CER and 6% organically) to EUR300m, and for EBITDA to \\n\\ngrow 11% to EUR42m. In our view, these numbers should assuage current market \\n\\nconcerns about the financial soundness of AMP. We see the fundamentals of the \\n\\nglobal hearing aid market as being intact, with organic growth of around 6% pa, \\n\\nwhich we expect to be distributed evenly across the major markets. We do not think \\n\\nthere were any special events during Q3 at Amplifon, but note that the acquisition of \\n\\nthe Spanish market leader Gaes was fully approved with no further conditions  \\n\\n(due to which we have made some minor changes to estimates). \\n\\nReiterate Buy rating and EUR24 TP, upside 45%: Our investment case is that \\n\\nAMP’s position as the largest retail market consolidator drives sales growth and \\n\\nprofitability. We believe its PE of 25.5x in FY19e – in line with its five-year average for \\n\\none-year forward PE – undervalues the 22% EPS CAGR over the next three years. \\n\\nCatalyst: Q3 results on 30

\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITIES ● HEALTH CARE EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n4 \\n\\nConcerns around Bose and OTC are overdone \\n\\nWhat happened? \\n\\nOn 5 October, Bose (a private company) received FDA approval for its first hearing aid. This is a \\n\\nworld first, as it will allow users to fit, programme and control the device on their own. In our \\n\\nassessment, this presented to market participants the long feared risk of a new player entering \\n\\nthe oligopolistic hearing aid market: 95% of the market is controlled by only five players. There \\n\\nhave been concerns it could bring down prices and thus margins of the wholesalers. \\n\\nThe other issue was whether the introduction of OTC hearing aids could also result in significant \\n\\npricing pressure for traditional premium hearing aids. \\n\\nNo news on the FDA’s OTC regulation. The FDA will publish its specification for Over-The-Counter \\n\\nhearing aid devices in August 2020, after which stakeholders can comment. Manufacturers can then \\n\\nstart developing, and eventually marketing, their devices. This means, in our view, that OTC will have \\n\\nan impact at the earliest from early 2021. That said, the approval for Bose’s device, in our view, has \\n\\nshown that the FDA is taking OTC seriously. \\n\\nOTC could be a risk for Amplifon… Of course, in a very negative scenario, it could be argued \\n\\nthat OTC devices will be so easy to fit that they will significantly reduce the prices of hearing aids: \\n\\ntwo-thirds of the hearing aid retail price is for fitting, service and warranty and only one-third for \\n\\nthe device itself. A reduction in the retail component of the hearing aid bundle price would \\n\\npresent significant savings potential for customers. However, experience in markets including \\n\\nSwitzerland, South Korea and Japan show that OTC self-fitting devices are not easy to fit and \\n\\nresult in an inferior sound quality. Less than 40% of wearers appear to be satisfied (see our \\n\\nreport Hearing aids: Looking for the next big thing, 3 September 2018, page 22 for more details). \\n\\nHowever, the devices offered in these three countries are very basic ones from manufacturers \\n\\nwith little experience in hearing aids. Bose is different as it has a very strong reputation for high \\n\\nquality devices. Unsurprisingly, it is one of the strongest advocates for the US OTC reform. \\n\\n…but we believe the downside risk from OTC self-fitting devices is limited and think OTC \\n\\nrepresents upside potential for Amplifon, for the following reasons: \\n\\n\\uf034 OTC represents an incremental sales opportunity: Self-fitting OTC devices are aimed at \\nyounger customers with only mild hearing loss. This is a significantly underpenetrated \\n\\nmarket, with penetration rates of only around 10% vs 30% for moderate to severe loss \\n\\n(Source: Amplifon). See the chart below showing penetration increasing significantly with \\n\\nthe severity of hearing loss. We believe increasing this penetration rate could lead to \\n\\nincremental unit sales for Amplifon, if it decided to enter the OTC market. \\n\\n \\nAmplifon five-year history of one-year forward PE \\n\\n \\n\\nSource: FactSet data \\n\\n \\n\\nIn our view, OTC represents \\n\\nupside potential for Amplifon \\n\\n15.0x\\n\\n20.0x\\n\\n25.0x\\n\\n30.0x\\n\\nOct-13 Mar-14 Aug-14 Jan-15 Jun-15 Nov-15 Apr-16 Sep-16 Feb-17 Jul-17 Dec-17 May-18\\n\\n1 year forward PE 5 year average\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/fzZmG9CcmplD\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\nEQUITIES ● HEALTH CARE EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n\\uf034 Little cannibalisation: Amplifon operates in the moderate to severe section of the hearing \\naid market. We think OTC devices will address only mild hearing loss. Hence the downside \\n\\nrisk is very limited. \\n\\n\\uf034 Selling restrictions will limit the medium-term impact of Bose’s device: Bose’s device \\nis not an OTC device, which means it has to be sold via a dispenser/audiologist in the US in \\n\\n45 out of 52 states. We think this is a significant hurdle for Bose. Although Bose has strong \\n\\nbrand equity for consumer headsets it has not been known previously as a hearing aid \\n\\nmanufacturer. This means that audiologists will first have to get acquainted with the device \\n\\nbefore recommending it to their customers. However, in some states online retailing of \\n\\nhearing aids is allowed. Some retailers, such as Walmart, use this opportunity to sell their \\n\\ndevices online into these states. It remains to be seen if Bose will be able to take advantage \\n\\nof the online opportunity, which has so far not been successful for hearing aids. \\n\\n\\uf034 Amplifon’s own OTC solution? This is an opportunity, albeit unlikely at this stage.  \\nVia the acquisition of the Spanish market leader, Gaes, Amplifon entered the hearing aid \\n\\nmanufacturing market (see our report Hearing aids: Looking for the next big thing,  \\n\\n3 September 2018, for details). Gaes only accounts for EUR36m of sales but it has a \\n\\nbudget device called Microson. We see an opportunity for Amplifon to significantly increase \\n\\nthe sales of this device and turn it into an OTC device. \\n\\nFurther, we believe Amplifon’s reputation should ensure a strong reception from consumers \\n\\nfor any OTC device it might launch. Amplifon has extremely high brand recognition, being \\n\\neither the number 1 or 2 hearing aid retailer in the 22 markets it operates in. As a case in \\n\\npoint, Amplifon launched its private label range in Q1 in Italy, a market that accounts for \\n\\n25% of Amplifon’s sales. By the end of Q2 the private label range already accounted for \\n\\n70% of Amplifon’s sales in Italy. \\n\\nQ3 preview: Another strong performance \\n\\nAmplifon will announce its Q3 results on 30 October. Overall, we expect another strong \\n\\nperformance, in line with the trend shown in H1. We estimate sales to have grown 8% y-o-y to \\n\\nEUR300m, with y-o-y sales growth of 9% in constant currencies and a good organic growth rate \\n\\nof slightly above 6%. We thus see a revenue contribution of around 3% from the acquisition of \\n\\nsmall stores. We expect EBITDA to have grown by 11% y-o-y to EUR42m, implying a margin of \\n\\n13.9%, up 40bps y-o-y. \\n\\n \\nPenetration rates tend to increase with the severity of hearing loss \\n\\n \\n\\nSource: Amplifon data \\n\\n \\n\\n0%\\n\\n10%\\n\\n20%\\n\\n30%\\n\\n40%\\n\\n50%\\n\\n60%\\n\\n70%\\n\\n80%\\n\\n90%\\n\\n100%\\n\\n25-40 40-70 70-95 >95\\n\\nP\\nen\\n\\net\\nra\\n\\nti\\no\\n\\nn\\n\\nMost quiet sounds heard in db\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/fzZmG9CcmplD\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITIES ● HEALTH CARE EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n6 \\n\\nWe do not expect any special events to have occurred in Q3. We believe the underlying hearing \\n\\naid market is performing robustly, growing at an organic rate of around 6%, distributed more or \\n\\nless evenly across all major developed countries. We see ASPs as still rising slightly, but with \\n\\ngrowth flattening except for the most premium products. In France, we expect the significantly \\n\\nincreased reimbursements (see our latest sector report Hearing aids: Looking for the next big \\n\\nthing, 3 September 2018) to have a gradual impact positive on sales from early 2019. We \\n\\nbelieve the roll-out of Amplifon’s private label range in Italy will have continued to progress well: \\n\\nwe expect its share of Amplifon’s Italian sales to have risen further from the already high 70% \\n\\nthat was announced with the Q2 results.  \\n\\nIt should be noted that, for the Americas region, Q3 2017 represents a very challenging base for \\n\\nearnings this year. In that quarter the Americas EBITDA margin increased 400bps to a high \\n\\n21.4%, on the back of strongly improving profitability in the core business, operational \\n\\nefficiencies and a very high investment level in Q3 2016. Our estimate for Q3 2018 of 18.3% is \\n\\nmore in line with the normal Americas margin range.  \\n\\n \\n\\nQ3 results preview  \\n\\n(EURm) Q3 2018e Q3 2017a y-o-y Consensus diff \\n\\nRevenues 299 278 7.7% 303 -1.1% \\n   EMEA 195 177 10.5% NA  \\n   Americas 59 55 6.5% NA  \\n   APAC 46 46 -0.8% NA  \\nEBITDA 41.5 36.0 15.3% 41.4 0.3% \\nMargin 13.9% 13.0% 91 bps 13.7% 19 bps \\nEBIT 25.5 20.9 21.9% 24.7 3.3% \\nMargin 8.5% 7.5% 99 bps 8.2%  \\nNet Income 13.9 10.0 38.4% 14.1 -1.5% \\nAdj.

We expect the integration of Gaes \\n\\nto be progressing well and, since the regulators have not imposed any additional conditions on \\n\\nthe acquisition, we change our estimates as follows. \\n\\nWe had previously assumed that, due to antitrust reasons, Amplifon would have to close around \\n\\n10% of Gaes’ stores in Spain, leading to reduced revenues of EUR192m and a reduced \\n\\nEBITDA of EUR27.4m at Gaes. Instead, we now assume EUR210m of sales, with an EBITDA \\n\\nof EUR30m (ie a 14.3% margin) as the 2018 base. Given the closure date of the acquisition we \\n\\nnow consolidate Gaes from 1 January 2019, rather than from Q2 this year. \\n\\nWe continue to expect EUR20m synergies to be possible in the medium term. We also continue \\n\\nto assume 5% y-o-y growth in 2019 for Gaes, increasing to 5.5% in 2020, as Gaes becomes \\n\\nmore efficient with the help of Amplifon. We now expect a mid-single digit EURm figure for the \\n\\nacquisition costs of Gaes to be charged in Q3. \\n\\nIn all, the changes to our Gaes assumptions mean that our 2018 estimates fall, but the impact \\n\\non our medium-term estimates is negligible. Hence we leave the remainder of our estimates \\n\\nessentially unchanged. \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/fzZmG9CcmplD\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/fzZmG9CcmplD\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nEQUITIES ● HEALTH CARE EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nChanges to our estimates \\n\\n(EURm)  2018e 2019e 2020e \\n\\nRevenues New 1,345 1,689 1,836 \\n Old 1,538 1,673 1,821 \\n Difference -12.6% 0.9% 0.8% \\nEBITDA New 234 304 343 \\n Old 268 301 341 \\n Difference -12.7% 1.0% 0.7% \\nEBITDA margin New 17.4% 18.0% 18.7% \\n Old 17.4% 18.0% 18.7% \\n Difference 0.0 ppt 0.0 ppt 0.0 ppt \\nEPS (EUR) New 0.47 0.65 0.78 \\n Old 0.51 0.63 0.76 \\n Difference -7.7% 3.3% 2.1% \\n\\nSource: HSBC estimates \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHSBC estimates versus consensus \\n\\n(EURm)  2018e 2019e 2020e \\n\\nRevenues HSBCe 1,345 1,689 1,836 \\n Cons 1,359 1,675 1,816 \\n Difference -1.0% 0.8% 1.1% \\nEBITDA HSBCe 234 304 343 \\n Cons 240 293 334 \\n Difference -2.5% 3.8% 2.8% \\nEBITDA margin HSBCe 17.4% 18.0% 18.7% \\n Cons 17.7% 17.5% 18.4% \\n Difference -0.3 ppt 0.5 ppt 0.3 ppt \\nEPS (EUR) HSBCe 0.47 0.65 0.78 \\n Cons 0.51 0.64 0.75 \\n Difference -7.7% 1.7% 3.5% \\n\\nSource: FactSet data, HSBC estimates \\n\\n \\n\\nValuation \\n\\nWe continue to value Amplifon using our DCF model, based on an equity risk premium of 5.0% and \\n\\na risk-free rate of 3.0%, beta of 0.8 and terminal growth of 2%.

Ratings should not be used or \\n\\nrelied on in isolation as investment advice. Different securities firms use a variety of ratings terms as well as different rating \\n\\nsystems to describe their recommendations and therefore investors should carefully read the definitions of the ratings used in \\n\\neach research report. Further, investors should carefully read the entire research report and not infer its contents from the rating \\n\\nbecause research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts\\' views and the basis for the rating. \\n\\nFrom 23rd March 2015 HSBC has assigned ratings on the following basis: \\n\\nThe target price is based on the analyst’s assessment of the stock’s actual current value, although we expect it to take six to 12 \\n\\nmonths for the market price to reflect this.  When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will \\n\\nbe classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a \\n\\nHold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between \\n\\n5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% \\n\\nbelow the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. \\n\\nOur ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any \\'material change\\' (initiation or resumption of coverage, change \\n\\nin target price or estimates).  \\n\\nUpside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. \\n\\nPrior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: \\n\\nFor each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropriate, \\n\\nregional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the \\n\\nstock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, \\n\\nthe potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the \\n\\nforecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 \\n\\nmonths (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was \\n\\nexpected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage \\n\\npoints for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. \\n\\n*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months \\n\\n(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, stocks which \\n\\nwe did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the past month\\'s \\n\\naverage of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, \\n\\nvolatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock\\'s status to change. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n9 \\n\\nEQUITIES ● HEALTH CARE EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nRating distribution for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nAs of 23 October 2018, the distribution of all independent ratings published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n \\nFor the purposes of the distribution above the following mapping structure is used during the transition from the previous to current \\n\\nrating models: under our previous model, Overweight = Buy, Neutral = Hold and Underweight = Sell; under our current model Buy \\n\\n= Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.

Corporate profitability is flourishing. The government’s focus on the private \\n\\nsector as the main growth engine should unlock efficiency gains. The average rise in \\n\\nheadline inflation has been c3.5% year to date, below the central bank’s target of a \\n\\n4% average for 2018. \\n\\nHealth of the banking sector – A high level of non-performing loans and a high \\n\\ncredit-to-GDP ratio are the key worries. However, some positive factors mitigate these \\n\\nrisks, such as an improvement in the credit culture, new laws allowing the easier \\n\\nresolution of collateral, and credit flow to more productive sectors. \\n\\nReal estate – We wanted to know where we are in the real estate cycle. We appear \\n\\nto be somewhere between the midpoint and the high point, but we are definitely not \\n\\nin bubble territory. Some key reasons why locals aren’t worried about a bubble are \\n\\n(1) an absorption rate of 65%, signifying strong demand; (2) the fact that bubbles are \\n\\nusually debt fuelled, but right now only 50% of sales are with mortgages; (3) soaring \\n\\nprices only in small segments rather than everywhere; and (4) an affordability level \\n\\nthat does not yet exclude ordinary people. \\n\\nTrade war and external outlook – At the moment, a common view is that Vietnam \\n\\nstands to benefit from US-China trade disputes as more of the value chain shifts from \\n\\nChina to its smaller but equally vibrant neighbour. The main threat – and it should not \\n\\nbe underestimated – is relative depreciation pressure from other currency weakness. \\n\\nMSCI upgrade. The final issue that came up during our visit was a hoped-for MSCI \\n\\nupgrade of Vietnam to Emerging Market status. However, this could be a couple of \\n\\nyears away, as the government needs to work on issues such as accounting standards, \\n\\naccessibility, and foreign ownership. \\n\\nWe remain positive – Vietnam is subject to near-term external risks, however, \\n\\nencouragingly, its structural weaknesses are being addressed. We acknowledge that \\n\\nmarket valuations appear high (17% premium to the country’s historical average). \\n\\nHowever, we believe earnings forecasts for 2018e at 9.4% are lower than is justified \\n\\nby the strong economy, impending privatisation reforms and corporate profitability. \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\nDevendra Joshi* \\nEquity Strategist, Asia Pacific \\n\\nThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited \\n\\ndevendrajoshi@hsbc.com.hk \\n\\n+852 2996 6592 \\n\\nRohit Mehboobani* \\nAssociate \\n\\nBangalore \\n\\n    \\n\\n \\n* Employed by a non-US affiliate of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc, and is \\nnot registered/ qualified pursuant to FINRA regulations \\n\\nAsia Frontier Insights EQUITY STRATEGY EM ASIA \\n\\n \\n\\n       Vietnam: From the ground up \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITY STRATEGY ● EM ASIA \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\n2 \\n\\nThe most pressing issues \\n\\nThe Vietnam equity market is down by 5% y-t-d. However, it has outperformed MSCI AxJ by 5% \\n\\nand MSCI Frontier Market Index by 8% y-t-d. Also, Vietnam is the only market in the region with \\n\\nnet foreign inflows. For a detailed discussion on relative attractiveness of Vietnamese equities \\n\\nand reasons for this outperformance, please see Asia Frontier Insights – Vietnam equities: \\n\\nPho’nomenal, 24 May 2018. \\n\\nDespite the outperformance, there have been concerns given that the market has come off \\n\\nsharply from its highs in April this year. The volatility was driven by a combination of factors, \\n\\nsuch as the reshuffling of money from the secondary market into IPOs (Vietnam had two of the \\n\\nbiggest IPOs in its history), profit-taking after a very strong bull run, and a broader emerging \\n\\nmarket pressure as a result of global factors, such as a strengthening USD, higher US yields \\n\\nand rising oil prices. We believe one of the main reason was speculation of market decline by \\n\\nlocal retail investors who dominate the market, in anticipation of foreign outflows. At the \\n\\nbeginning of this year a stronger USD weakened appetite for EM assets, including frontier \\n\\nmarkets. This was exacerbated by increased participation of locals in derivatives market. Locals \\n\\ncould now use the derivative market (launched in August 2017) to speculate on a market \\n\\ndecline For example, total trading value of VN30 index futures rose by 11x between April and \\n\\nJuly1 this year where 95% of participants were local retail investors2. \\n\\n   \\n\\nVietnam is an outperformer …  … and the only market with net foreign \\ninflows \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSource: MSCI, Thomson Reuters, HSBC  Source: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n\\n   \\n\\n______________________________________ \\n\\n1 “Derivatives rise as a profit-making tool rather than a risk-hedging”, Vietnam News, 9 July 2018 \\n\\n2 “Local derivatives market busy after only one year of operation”, VietnamNet, 14 August 2018 \\n\\n85\\n\\n90\\n\\n95\\n\\n100\\n\\n105\\n\\n110\\n\\n115\\n\\n120\\n\\n125\\n\\nJan-18 Mar-18 May-18 Jul-18\\n\\nMSCI AxJ MSCI FM VN Index\\n\\nJan 2018=100, USD \\n\\n-10.0\\n\\n-8.0\\n\\n-6.0\\n\\n-4.0\\n\\n-2.0\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n2.0\\n\\nVN IN PH KR ID TH TW\\n\\n2018 FII Flows y-t-d (USD Bn)\\n\\nStill on the right course \\n\\n\\uf034 Growth is still strong as focus shifts to private sector from SOEs \\n\\n\\uf034 Inflation is up, but price rises are not broad-based \\n\\n\\uf034 NPLs still a worry and real estate a bit frothy, but both steadying \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/HKwptGc\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/HKwptGc\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n\\n3 \\n\\nEQUITY STRATEGY ● EM ASIA \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\nGiven this, we recently hosted a four-day trip to Vietnam for a large group of foreign investors, \\n\\nto assess and update ourselves on the country. We had more than 25 meetings with \\n\\ncompanies, banks, economists, and officials. In this note, we discuss the five most pressing \\n\\nissues that came up: \\n\\n1. Growth outlook and risk of inflation \\n\\n2. Health of the banking sector \\n\\n3. The rise of Vietnamese real estate \\n\\n4. Trade issues \\n\\n5. MSCI inclusion \\n\\nBelow we address these one-by-one. \\n\\nIssue 1 – Growth outlook and risk of inflation \\n\\nVietnam is a high-growth market. Even when the country was going through a downturn, real \\n\\ngrowth was around 5%. Manufacturing PMIs are rising while agriculture and retail are both \\n\\nexpanding. Behind this strong performance is increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) that \\n\\nfeeds into economic reforms; together these translate into employment opportunities, which in \\n\\nturn leads to rising disposable incomes, allowing for improvements in corporate profitability. Even \\n\\nplastic surgery and cosmetics sales are rising – in the growing numbers of chic coffee shops and \\n\\nrestaurants there are occasional clinics that offer Botox treatment, hitherto a rarity in Vietnam. \\n\\n   \\n\\nExhibit 1. Economic growth  Exhibit 2. Growth led by manufacturing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream, HSBC  Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream, HSBC \\n\\n   \\n\\nVietnam’s economy is still dominated by state owned enterprises (SOEs), although they are less \\n\\nefficient than the private sector. Thus, during our meetings local businesses and experts were \\n\\nenthusiastic about the fact that government has stressed that it wishes to promote the growth of \\n\\nthe private sector3. The potential from this is enormous. In fact, the IMF has raised its GDP \\n\\nestimate for the country to a comfortable 6.5% beyond 2018. \\n\\nCorporate profitability is also flourishing. Across the economy in 2Q 2018 sales grew by 22.9% \\n\\ny-o-y (23.4% if you exclude financials). Net income grew by 21.5% y-o-y (financials 27.9%; non-\\n\\nfinancials 18.6%). \\n\\nOne of the consumer companies with which we met said even the ‘mature’ categories were \\n\\nenjoying significant growth: for 1H2018 seasonings were up 42% y-o-y, noodles 37% and coffee \\n\\n16% y-o-y. A jewellery company reported same-store sales growth of 23% in its gold business. \\n\\n______________________________________ \\n\\n3 “Vietnam looks to bolster private sector output”, Financial Times, 27 March 2018 \\n\\n5.0\\n\\n5.5\\n\\n6.0\\n\\n6.5\\n\\n7.0\\n\\n7.5\\n\\n8.0\\n\\n2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017\\n\\nVietnam annual GDP growth %\\n\\n48\\n\\n49\\n\\n50\\n\\n51\\n\\n52\\n\\n53\\n\\n54\\n\\n55\\n\\n56\\n\\nAug-15 Feb-16 Aug-16 Feb-17 Aug-17 Feb-18\\n\\nVietnam mfg PMI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITY STRATEGY ● EM ASIA \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\n4 \\n\\nWhat about inflation? \\n\\nAll this growth in demand pushes up prices. Inflation reached 4.5% y-o-y in July, up from 2.7% \\n\\ny-o-y in January, primarily due to rising energy costs and pork prices – up 12% y-o-y from a low \\n\\nbase. Even so, core inflation remains muted at 1.4% y-o-y, suggesting price pressures are not \\n\\nbroad based. The average rise in headline inflation has been 3.5% y-t-d, below the State Bank \\n\\nof Vietnam’s target of a 4% average for 2018. So, no need yet for an aggressive hiking cycle. \\n\\nBut a weaker currency could be a risk. HSBC economist Noelan Arbis expects a 25bp hike from \\n\\nthe SBV in 3Q 2018 and forecasts 6.7% GDP growth for 2018 (Vietnam at a glance: The case for \\n\\ntightening, 1 August 2018). \\n\\n   \\n\\nExhibit 3.

Having said that there are some factors that are helping improve the situation. \\n\\nLocal banks commented that new credit is going to the private and retail sectors while the rate \\n\\nof credit growth for SOEs has fallen. This also is in line with the government’s focus on \\n\\npromoting private enterprises as the engine of growth for the economy. Consumer lending has \\n\\nbeen the fastest-growing sector, above 30% y-o-y. The central bank has been watching \\n\\nconsumer lending and is being prudent. Credit growth has slowed from the previous year and \\n\\nthe credit growth target for 2018 is 17%. Remember that Vietnam pulls economic levers through \\n\\nits credit growth target. In the past, banks were allowed to exceed that target on request but, \\n\\naccording to news reports, the central bank will not allow any further extensions. \\n\\nTwo key factors in NPL formation in the past have been (1) loans given to inefficient SOEs and \\n\\n(2) cross ownership of corporates and banks. The government has been working on this, as \\n\\nevident from its SOE privatisation drive. It has taken SOEs out from local government \\n\\nmanagement, and grouped them under one national department. Meanwhile cross ownership is \\n\\nnow prohibited. \\n\\nCompliance is playing an important part in changing the credit culture, too, given the recent anti-\\n\\ncorruption drive4 – bank managers are now more careful and prudent in risk assessment before \\n\\nsanctioning new loans. \\n\\n______________________________________ \\n\\n4 “Investors in Vietnam learn to live with anti-corruption crackdown, some embrace it”, Reuters, 28 March 2018 \\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\nJan-06 Jan-08 Jan-10 Jan-12 Jan-14 Jan-16 Jan-18\\n\\nVietnam CPI, yoy %\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/6cLkXnJ\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/6cLkXnJ\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n\\n5 \\n\\nEQUITY STRATEGY ● EM ASIA \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\nNonetheless, NPLs remain an issue. However, new laws allowing the easier resolution of \\n\\ncollateral have been passed and hence banks have been able to recover some of their bad \\n\\ndebts. But, importantly, strong economic growth has increased banks’ profitability. As a result, \\n\\nsome of the banks have already written off their bad debts while some are in the process of \\n\\ndoing so. Moody’s recently upgraded Vietnam’s sovereign rating to Ba35.

This \\n\\nmeans that increased competition in this space might pull down margins. To mitigate this, banks \\n\\nare looking to lower their funding cost by improving their CASA mix. \\n\\nIssue 3 – Real estate \\n\\nThe high NPLs in Vietnam resulted from a real estate bubble a decade ago. Therefore, a strong \\n\\npick-up in the real estate sector over the last couple of years has raised concerns. The good \\n\\nnews is that supply demand dynamics in the residential segment improved in the first half of this \\n\\nyear. A real estate expert told us that in Ho Chi Minh City supply has come down by 30% while \\n\\nsales are up 22%. This has pushed inventory to a multi-year low. Supply has slowed due to \\n\\nvarious factors – availability of land, increased scrutiny of developers and of land allocation by \\n\\nthe government. One of the banks told us the sector was slow as the government had held up a \\n\\nlot of permits in H1. In addition to demand from newly created households due to the young \\n\\npopulation and due to rising incomes, remittances from Vietnamese living and working outside \\n\\nthe country continue to find their way into real estate. \\n\\nWhere are we in the real estate cycle? This is a question that we asked almost everyone we \\n\\nmet. The general opinion was that we are somewhere between the midpoint and the high point; \\n\\nit may be frothy in some segments, but we are definitely not in bubble territory. Some key \\n\\nreasons why locals aren’t worried about a bubble are (1) an absorption rate of 65%, signifying \\n\\nstrong demand; (2) the fact that bubbles are usually debt fuelled, but right now only 50% of \\n\\nsales are with mortgages; (3) many-fold price increases only in small segments rather than \\n\\neverywhere; and (4) an affordability level that is not yet beyond the reach of ordinary people. \\n\\n(According to the JETRO 2017 survey, a manufacturing manager in Vietnam earns close to \\n\\nUSD1,300 per month. So we assume that a young working couple looking to buy an apartment \\n\\nwould earn somewhere around USD2,600 per month. Now, a 100-square-metre apartment \\n\\ncosting USD1,200 per square meter, with loan-to-value ratio of 60% at an 11% mortgage rate \\n\\nfor 20 years would require a monthly payment of USD750. So mortgage payments for this \\n\\nproperty would equal roughly 25% of the couple’s monthly income.) \\n\\n______________________________________ \\n\\n5 “Moody’s upgrades Vietnam’s ratings to Ba3, changes outlook to stable”, Moody’s, 10 August 2018 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITY STRATEGY ● EM ASIA \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\n6 \\n\\nIssue 4 – Trade wars \\n\\nGiven that Vietnam is an export-oriented economy, the brewing trade war between China and \\n\\nthe US is one of the main concerns for investors. Vietnam has been a favourite FDI destination \\n\\nin ASEAN due to the combination of a young and skilled labour force, favourable tax policies, \\n\\ngeographic advantage, relatively better infrastructure and stable politics. These factors will \\n\\ncontinue to attract FDI into Vietnam. The general opinion among local experts and economists \\n\\nwas that a trade war between US and China might present an opportunity for Vietnam to \\n\\nincrease exports to the US. This could also accelerate the movement of supply chains to \\n\\nVietnam. Also, Vietnam does not generally compete directly with China but tries to pick up the \\n\\nmarket share relinquished by China as it moves up the value curve. \\n\\n \\n\\nExhibit 7.

Structurally \\n\\nthe current account is moving into a surplus, driven by remittances and tourism while on the \\n\\nfinancial side FDI and FII are positive. If the trade war escalates and Vietnam becomes a target \\n\\n(as a lot of exports pass through Vietnam’s supply chain), there are further risks of downside to \\n\\nVND. HSBC FX strategists’ year-end forecast for USD-VND is 23,200. This is in line with the \\n\\nforecast of USD-RMB at 6.70. \\n\\nHowever, if trade tensions continue to intensify, then so will the downside risk to the VND. \\n\\nDespite being one of the best performers in the region in 1H 2018, the VND has depreciated \\n\\nfaster than we had anticipated in 2H 2018 so far. This is largely in reaction to external factors \\n\\nthat have been working against the currency, notably, RMB weakness. Indeed, this has had a \\n\\nlarger impact on the VND than did the US’s tariffs on imports of washing machines, solar \\n\\npanels, steel, and aluminium from Vietnam since February and March. A weaker RMB has led \\n\\nto higher fixing rates as a policy response from the SBV. This is understandable – China is an \\n\\nimportant trade partner for Vietnam, accounting for more than 20% of the country’s total trade \\n\\n(see Paul Mackel et al, Asian FX Focus: VND, 10 August 2018). \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/pCLbt7v\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n\\n7 \\n\\nEQUITY STRATEGY ● EM ASIA \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\nExhibit 8.

However, this could be a couple of years away, as the government \\n\\nneeds to work on issues such as accounting standards, accessibility, and foreign ownership. \\n\\nThe last is a key point for foreign investors, as the most of the investable companies have \\n\\nalready reached their foreign ownership limits (FOLs). To be fair, this is not always due to \\n\\nVietnam’s regulations. Some of these companies operate in multiple business segments. Even \\n\\nif one of those segments (however small it may be) is restricted for foreign investors under \\n\\nVietnam regulations, then these companies would need to divest from those segments to lift \\n\\nforeign ownership limits at firm level. Companies might not want to do that. Another issue is that, \\n\\nunder investment law, companies with foreign ownership of more than 49% are regarded as \\n\\nforeign companies, which prevents them from buying other local companies and restricts M&A. \\n\\nSummary \\n\\nVietnam valuations are high. The VN index trades at 17.4x PE, which is 17% above its five-year \\n\\naverage. In comparison, the MSCI Frontier market index is trading at 11% of the five-year average. \\n\\n   \\n\\nExhibit 10.

Ratings should not be used or \\n\\nrelied on in isolation as investment advice. Different securities firms use a variety of ratings terms as well as different rating \\n\\nsystems to describe their recommendations and therefore investors should carefully read the definitions of the ratings used in \\n\\neach research report. Further, investors should carefully read the entire research report and not infer its contents from the rating \\n\\nbecause research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts’ views and the basis for the rating. \\n\\nFrom 23rd March 2015 HSBC has assigned ratings on the following basis: \\n\\nThe target price is based on the analyst’s assessment of the stock’s actual current value, although we expect it to take six to 12 \\n\\nmonths for the market price to reflect this. When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will \\n\\nbe classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a \\n\\nHold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between \\n\\n5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% \\n\\nbelow the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. \\n\\nOur ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any ‘material change’ (initiation or resumption of coverage, change \\n\\nin target price or estimates). \\n\\nUpside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. \\n\\nPrior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: \\n\\nFor each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropriate, \\n\\nregional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the \\n\\nstock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, \\n\\nthe potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the \\n\\nforecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 \\n\\nmonths (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was \\n\\nexpected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage \\n\\npoints for a stock classified as Volatile*). Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. \\n\\n*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months \\n\\n(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility. However, stocks which \\n\\nwe did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way. Historical volatility was defined as the past month’s \\n\\naverage of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities. To avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, volatility had \\n\\nto move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock’s status to change. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITY STRATEGY ● EM ASIA \\n\\n20 August 2018 \\n\\n10 \\n\\nRating distribution for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nAs of 17 August 2018, the distribution of all independent ratings published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n \\nFor the purposes of the distribution above the following mapping structure is used during the transition from the previous to current \\n\\nrating models: under our previous model, Overweight = Buy, Neutral = Hold and Underweight = Sell; under our current model Buy \\n\\n= Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.

Driven by the Americas truck orders total \\n\\norders rose by 26% for a book to bill (12m rolling average) of 1.19 providing a solid \\n\\nbase for next year, when revenues should at least stay flat. Better pricing and an \\n\\namelioration of supply chain issues suggest that margins will rise further. Driven by \\n\\nNA and Europe, Construction Equipment orders rose by 22% for a book to bill of 1.05 \\n\\nsuggesting that demand in NA and Europe will remain solid and that the margin here \\n\\nshould therefore remain stable. \\n\\nEarnings upgrades: Because of rising expectations for Trucks, VCE and Penta we \\n\\nraise our forecasts for this year and next. Given that 2019 is most likely to be the \\n\\npeak in global truck demand in this inventory cycle, our forecast for 2020 is modestly \\n\\ncut. Our Truck EBIT forecast now reflects a margin of 10.9% and 11.3% for this year \\n\\nand next, respectively, before we see a decline of 110bps in 2020e to 10.2%. For the \\n\\ngroup, we now forecast margins of 10.5%, 10.9% and 10.3%, respectively. This \\n\\ncompares to management’s through cycle margin target of 10%. \\n\\nExhaust system degradation: Volvo detected a premature degradation in the \\n\\nexhaust system of one of its most popular truck engines, which leads to higher NOx \\n\\nemissions. These degradations have not been universal and have been limited to \\n\\ncertain applications and certain regions. According to management, the problem has \\n\\nbeen isolated and a solution is available. Given that the exhaust system is designed \\n\\nfor the lifetime of the truck, a costly replacement for a large number of trucks may be \\n\\nrequired. Given that the trucks meet emission standards at delivery, this should be a \\n\\ncost issue and not a governance issue. \\n\\nFair value versus the cycle: We maintain our Buy rating given that we see earnings \\n\\nupgrades coming through, which should drive the share price into a cyclical peak in \\n\\n2019. That said, we cut our TP to SEK180 from SEK195. Higher earnings estimates \\n\\nin 2018e and 2019e are offset by higher WACC of 7.7%, rather than 7.1%, which \\n\\ntakes into account a significant risk associated with costs originating from the \\n\\ndegradation of its exhausts systems. \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nMAINTAIN BUY \\n\\nTARGET PRICE (SEK) PREVIOUS TARGET (SEK) \\n\\n180.00 195.00 \\n\\nSHARE PRICE (SEK) UPSIDE/DOWNSIDE

strong performance in 2019  \\n\\nVolvo reported a very solid quarter characterised by strong orders (up 26% in trucks and 22% in \\n\\nconstruction equipment), strong lfl revenue growth of 13% (15% at Trucks and 16% at VCE) and \\n\\nstrong operating earnings (up 50%) for a group margin of 10.9% (up 210bps). Compared with \\n\\nmarket expectations truck orders beat by 11%, group revenues were in line and operating \\n\\nearnings beat by 7% (headline) or 5% if adjusted for a small gain.  \\n\\nManagement also gave an outlook for its end markets in 2019 which are broadly in line with our \\n\\nexpectations. Management expects North American retail sales to rise by 10k to 310k units and \\n\\nEuropean sales to decline by 15k to 300k units with risk to the upside in NA and downside \\n\\nprotection in Europe (see below). After yet another very strong year in China demand is \\n\\nexpected to retract, while demand in India and South America should continue to rise. Looking \\n\\nat the mid-point of expectations we are looking for higher demand for construction equipment in \\n\\nNA, flat demand in Europe and South America and lower demand in Asia. \\n\\n \\n\\nGlobal truck demand (total registration based in 000’) \\n\\n \\n\\nSource: ACT, ACEA, IHS, HSBCe \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-30%\\n\\n-15%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n15%\\n\\n30%\\n\\n45%\\n\\n60%\\n\\n0\\n\\n400\\n\\n800\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n2,000\\n\\n2,400\\n\\n20\\n00\\n\\n20\\n01\\n\\n20\\n02\\n\\n20\\n03\\n\\n20\\n04\\n\\n20\\n05\\n\\n20\\n06\\n\\n20\\n07\\n\\n20\\n08\\n\\n20\\n09\\n\\n20\\n10\\n\\n20\\n11\\n\\n20\\n12\\n\\n20\\n13\\n\\n20\\n14\\n\\n20\\n15\\n\\n20\\n16\\n\\n20\\n17\\n\\n20\\n18\\n\\ne\\n\\n20\\n19\\n\\ne\\n\\n20\\n20\\n\\ne\\n\\nDeveloped markets Emerging markets Global market y-o-y growth\\n\\nStrong performance in 2019e \\n\\nvs downturn in 2020e \\n\\n\\uf034 Strong truck and Construction Equipment orders provide backdrop \\n\\nfor solid earnings growth in 2019 \\n\\n\\uf034 We raise our earnings estimates for this year and next by roughly \\n\\n10%, whilst we modestly cut our 2020e estimates \\n\\n\\uf034 We cut our target price from SEK195 to SEK180 as higher earnings \\n\\nestimates are offset by higher risks \\n\\nHealthy beat on orders and \\n\\nprofits \\n\\nSolid outlook for truck and \\n\\nconstruction equipment \\n\\nmarkets in 2019  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITIES ● MACHINERY \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n4 \\n\\nExhaust system degradation: Volvo detected a premature degradation in the exhaust system of \\n\\none of its most popular truck engines, which leads to higher NOx emissions.

Higher earnings estimates in 2018e and 2019e are offset by a higher WACC \\n\\nassumption of 7.7%, which is based on a net cost of debt of 1.7%, risk free rate of 3.0%, beta of \\n\\n1.25 (up from 1.2 to address the risk associated with the degradation of the exhaust systems) \\n\\nand a risk premium of 5.0%, which overall takes into account a significant risk associated with \\n\\nthe cost originating from the degradation of the exhausts systems. Our previous WACC \\n\\nassumption of 7.1% was based on a net cost of debt of 1.6%, risk free rate of 2.5%, beta of 1.2 \\n\\nand risk premium of 5%). \\n\\nThe impact of the higher risk premium associated to the degradation of the exhausts systems is \\n\\nroughly equivalent to SEK10bn, which would cover roughly half the trucks delivered in North \\n\\nAmerica from the change to EPA 10 and the change in Europe to Euro 6, at a cost of repair of \\n\\naround SEK20,000 per unit. \\n\\nOur new fair value target price implies upside of c35% and we reiterate our Buy rating on the \\n\\nstock as we expect Self-help to continue to drive margin expansion. Our target price equates to \\n\\na 2019e exit PE of 11.7x and EV/EBITDA of 5.0x \\n\\nRating: We maintain our Buy rating on Volvo given that we see upside earnings risks and \\n\\nexpect consensus numbers to move up (see the bottom chart at page 4), which should support \\n\\nthe share price. As always at this stage of a cycle, concerns about the next downturn may \\n\\ninhibit full share price appreciation to fair value, which we estimate is, however, almost 35% \\n\\nabove the current share price. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nEQUITIES ● MACHINERY \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nQ3 results summary \\n\\nAs outlined above and discussed in more detail below orders were again very strong rising 26% \\n\\nin trucks and 22% at VCE. \\n\\n \\n\\nVolvo: Q3 result summary \\n\\nSEKm; y/e December Q2 \\n2017a \\n\\nQ3 \\n2017a \\n\\nQ4 \\n2017a \\n\\nQ1 \\n2018a \\n\\nQ2 \\n2018a \\n\\nQ3 \\n2018e \\n\\n% y-o-y  HSBCe   \\n(Q3 18) \\n\\n% vs. \\nHSBCe \\n\\nSME \\nDirekt \\n\\n% vs. \\ncons \\n\\nTruck orders (units) 55,265 51,955 69,597 71,965 60,656 65,348 25.8% 57,923 12.8% 59,000 10.8% \\n - Europe 28,583 23,296 35,606 31,321 27,306 24,324 4.4% 23,235 4.7%   \\n - N.

Our assumption that Return on \\n\\nIncremental Capital will be higher than the historical 10-year \\n\\naverage RoCE reflects our view that that margins will be higher \\n\\nas current management has avoided producing very poor results \\n\\nin a downturn and our belief that it will mean more upside in an \\n\\nupturn. We assume medium-term growth in capital employed of \\n\\n3%, which gives us a ten-year prospective CAGR of 1.0%, \\n\\ncompared to 2.4% over the last ten years. \\n\\n \\n\\nWe calculate a new WACC of 7.7% (7.1% previously), which is \\n\\nnow based on a net cost of debt of 1.7% (from 1.6%) and a new \\n\\ncost of equity of 9.25% (up from 8.50%). For cost of equity, we \\n\\nassume a beta of 1.25 (up from 1.20 to address the exhaust \\n\\ndegradation issue), risk free rate of 3.0% (up from 2.5%) and \\n\\nMRP of 5.0% (unchanged) as we believe the truck cycle will \\n\\nattain a peak in 2019 and then there is a risk of downside, also \\n\\nthe current degradation issue of its trucks pose some \\n\\nchallenges. The changes in the above broader assumptions and \\n\\nincrease of our 2018e-2019e estimates and decrease in our \\n\\n2020e estimates gives us a new fair value target price of \\n\\nSEK180, down from SEK195. \\n\\n \\n\\nOur new fair value target price implies upside of 35% and we \\n\\nreiterate our Buy rating on the stock as we expect Self-help to \\n\\ncontinue to drive margin expansion. Our target price equates to \\n\\na 2019e exit PE of 11.7x and EV/EBITDA of 5.0x. \\n\\nDownside risks include:  Weaker-than-expected \\n\\nprogress on cost-cutting; weaker-than-expected end-\\n\\nmarkets (eg lower in Europe, North America and slow \\n\\nrecovery in China); FX turning unfavourable for Volvo: \\n\\nand stronger headwinds from raw material price \\n\\nincreases \\n\\n \\n\\nBuy \\n\\n \\n\\n     \\n\\nPriced at 22 Oct 2018 \\nSource: HSBC estimates \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\nEQUITIES ● MACHINERY \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nDisclosure appendix \\n\\nAnalyst Certification \\n\\nThe following analyst(s), economist(s), or strategist(s) who is(are) primarily responsible for this report, including any analyst(s) \\n\\nwhose name(s) appear(s) as author of an individual section or sections of the report and any analyst(s) named as the covering \\n\\nanalyst(s) of a subsidiary company in a sum-of-the-parts valuation certifies(y) that the opinion(s) on the subject security(ies) or \\n\\nissuer(s), any views or forecasts expressed in the section(s) of which such individual(s) is(are) named as author(s), and any other \\n\\nviews or forecasts expressed herein, including any views expressed on the back page of the research report, accurately reflect \\n\\ntheir personal view(s) and that no part of their compensation was, is or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific \\n\\nrecommendation(s) or views contained in this research report: Michael Hagmann \\n\\nImportant disclosures \\n\\nEquities: Stock ratings and basis for financial analysis \\n\\nHSBC and its affiliates, including the issuer of this report (“HSBC”) believes an investor\\'s decision to buy or sell a stock should \\n\\ndepend on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s existing holdings, risk tolerance and other considerations and that \\n\\ninvestors utilise various disciplines and investment horizons when making investment decisions. Ratings should not be used or \\n\\nrelied on in isolation as investment advice. Different securities firms use a variety of ratings terms as well as different rating \\n\\nsystems to describe their recommendations and therefore investors should carefully read the definitions of the ratings used in \\n\\neach research report. Further, investors should carefully read the entire research report and not infer its contents from the rating \\n\\nbecause research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts\\' views and the basis for the rating. \\n\\nFrom 23rd March 2015 HSBC has assigned ratings on the following basis: \\n\\nThe target price is based on the analyst’s assessment of the stock’s actual current value, although we expect it to take six to 12 \\n\\nmonths for the market price to reflect this.  When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will \\n\\nbe classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a \\n\\nHold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between \\n\\n5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% \\n\\nbelow the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. \\n\\nOur ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any \\'material change\\' (initiation or resumption of coverage, change \\n\\nin target price or estimates).  \\n\\nUpside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. \\n\\nPrior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: \\n\\nFor each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropriate, \\n\\nregional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the \\n\\nstock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, \\n\\nthe potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the \\n\\nforecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 \\n\\nmonths (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was \\n\\nexpected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage \\n\\npoints for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. \\n\\n*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months \\n\\n(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, stocks which \\n\\nwe did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the past month\\'s \\n\\naverage of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, \\n\\nvolatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock\\'s status to change. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITIES ● MACHINERY \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n12 \\n\\nRating distribution for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nAs of 23 October 2018, the distribution of all independent ratings published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n \\nFor the purposes of the distribution above the following mapping structure is used during the transition from the previous to current \\n\\nrating models: under our previous model, Overweight = Buy, Neutral = Hold and Underweight = Sell; under our current model Buy \\n\\n= Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.

After the pick-up in EM \\n\\nvolatility earlier this year, vol now looks to be spilling over into DM. Our analysts \\n\\ndiscuss whether volatility has returned, alongside possible catalysts for sustaining \\n\\nhigher DM vol, including US mid-term elections and continuing Italian concerns. \\n\\nWe then discuss the implications of higher vol across asset classes. In rates, we note \\n\\nhow the pick-up in vol is more acute in long-dated vols than short-dated vols – a clear \\n\\ncontrast to the moves we saw in the February equity sell-off. In FX, the EUR is \\n\\ndisplaying higher realised vol than its G10 counterparts. Finally, in EM we expect \\n\\nfurther headwinds from tight financial conditions and trade protectionism to prevent \\n\\nvolatility from fading. In summary, we think that a new volatility wave is under way. \\n\\nPart II: RORO Resurgence \\n\\nCross-asset correlations are exhibiting a distinctly Risk On – Risk Off (RORO) profile. \\n\\nIt appears that the RORO paradigm acts as a muscle memory in periods where \\n\\nvolatility picks up and global equities sell off.  \\n\\nThis structure of cross-asset correlations fits well with our broad strategy view. We \\n\\nstill favour US equities over Europe and we remain cautious about EM given the \\n\\ncurrent environment. Meanwhile, we have a bearish credit outlook in Europe and \\n\\nAsia (neutral US), and maintain our bullish US Treasuries view – we look through to \\n\\n2020 when we expect Fed rate cuts. We continue to look for further USD \\n\\nappreciation as the Fed delivers on its dots for now, but would also expect the USD \\n\\nto gain if the US economy slows materially. In summary: we still broadly favour USD \\n\\nassets. \\n\\nWe highlight key HSBC Global Research publications across asset classes: \\n\\n\\uf034 Multi-asset Why EM matters tactically \\n\\uf034 FX USD bears laid bare: Currency Outlook \\n\\uf034 Fixed Income Looking right through \\n\\uf034 Economics Diverging Fortunes \\n\\uf034 EM Shaky foundations \\n\\uf034 Global Equities Shaken but not stirred \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nPierre Blanchet \\nHead of Multi Asset Strategy \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\npierre.blanchet@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 5388 \\n\\nSteven Major, CFA \\nGlobal Head of Fixed Income Research  \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nsteven.j.major@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 5980 \\n\\nMark McDonald \\nHead of FX Quantitative Strategy \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nmark.mcdonald@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 5966 \\n\\nDr. Murat Ulgen \\nGlobal Head of Emerging Markets Research \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nmuratulgen@hsbc.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 6782 \\n\\nDavid Bloom \\nGlobal Head of FX Research \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\ndavid.bloom@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 5969 \\n\\nSubhrajit Banerjee, CFA \\nFixed Income Strategist \\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nsubhrajit.banerjee@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 6851 \\n\\nAndre de Silva, CFA \\nHead of Global EM Rates Research \\nThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited \\n\\nandre.de.silva@hsbc.com.hk \\n\\n+852 2822 2217 \\n\\nFabio Balboni \\nEuropean Economist \\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nfabio.balboni@hsbc.com \\n\\n+44 20 7992 0374 \\n\\nChris Attfield \\nStrategist \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nchristopher.attfield@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 2133 \\n\\nDaniel Grosvenor* \\nEquity Strategist \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\ndaniel.grosvenor@hsbcib.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 4246 \\n\\nMax Kettner \\nMulti Asset Strategist \\n\\nHSBC Bank plc \\n\\nmaximilian.l.kettner@hsbc.com \\n\\n+44 20 7991 5045 \\n\\n \\n\\n* Employed by a non-US affiliate of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc, and is \\nnot registered/ qualified pursuant to FINRA regulations \\n\\nMulti-Asset Analysts\\' Meeting MULTI-ASSET GLOBAL \\n\\n \\n\\n       RORO, Muscle Memory, and the rise of Vol \\n\\nhttp://www.research.hsbc.com/\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/7zbjjzk\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/kWXcrlD\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/vkpJLDX\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/X9dkpHm\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/PdZRCSQ\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n \\n\\nPart I: The return of volatility \\n\\n \\n\\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nGood afternoon everyone. \\n\\nFollowing the recent market sell-off, we’d like to discuss the topics of volatility and correlation, and \\n\\nimplications across the asset classes. Mark is there evidence of a return of volatility? \\n\\n \\n\\nMark McDonald \\n\\nOur Cross-Asset Volatility Indicator (CRAVIN, Figure 1) is definitely not low anymore as it’s back in the \\n\\n25-75 percentile range, but it’s not at objectively high levels either. It does look like we have passed the \\n\\nlows in vol, particularly when you take this information in conjunction with our volatility wave analysis \\n\\n(Figure 2). A new volatility wave is building, and the volatility wave chart suggests that once volatility \\n\\npicks up in some asset classes, it typically spills over into others. \\n\\n Figure 1: Our Cross-asset Volatility Indicator (CRAVIN) \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n Figure 2: A new wave of Vol is starting to develop  \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nAt the start of this wave, increased vol was just an EM phenomenon. Now are you suggesting that \\n\\nvolatility is rising in DM, too? \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nYes – in August we highlighted this volatility divergence between EM and DM (see EM-DM vol \\n\\ndivergence, 8 August 2018). Back then, the EM vol premium was high, whereas the DM vol premium \\n\\nremained low, suggesting that the market was happy for this divergence to continue. That has now \\n\\nchanged. With the recent equity sell-off implied vols are definitely higher now across DM too, although \\n\\nthere is not enough data to know whether realised vol in DM has picked up. The sort of complacency in \\n\\nthe pricing of DM vols that we saw in the summer has gone. \\n\\n Figure 3: Implied volatilities of DM Equity and Rates have risen \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nI suppose the catalyst for sustaining higher vol. could be political uncertainties. Ryan, we have the \\n\\nUS mid-terms just around the corner. Could they become a source of volatility? \\n\\n \\n\\nRyan Wang \\n\\nThe outlook for the US mid-terms hasn’t changed considerably over the last month. It’s still \\n\\nanticipated from the polling data we have, that the Democrats will take control of the House of \\n\\nRepresentatives. The Senate is much less likely to switch control from its current Republican \\n\\nmajority (see US Midterm Elections, Divided Congress still possible, 22 October 2018).  \\n\\nIrrespective of the election results, it doesn’t look like the issue of trade protectionism will go away. \\n\\nThere is a scheduled increase in US tariffs to 25% from 10% on USD200bn of imports from China. If \\n\\nthat were to take effect at the start of next year, then investors might start to worry about the risk of a \\n\\nthird tranche of tariffs, potentially impacting all US imports from China. \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nIn Europe, although Brexit uncertainties might be close to an end, Italy puts the European Union in \\n\\nunchartered territories. Fabio, Chris, do you think Italy can remain a source of market volatility? \\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n60\\n\\n65\\n\\n70\\n\\n75\\n\\n80\\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\nJan-18 Feb-18 Mar-18 Apr-18 May-18 Jun-18 Jul-18 Aug-18 Sep-18 Oct-18\\n\\nEquity Implied Vol (percentage points, LHS) Rates Implied Vol (basis points, RHS)\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/VPjRvr2\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/VPjRvr2\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/N72wzQrjvvqx\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\n\\nFabio Balboni \\n\\nMoody\\'s downward revision of Italy’s sovereign rating but with a stable outlook was seen with some \\n\\nrelief by markets. But it changes very little of the overall outlook and risks. Last week the European \\n\\nCommission (EC) sent a letter to the Italian government noting the \"unprecedented\" divergence \\n\\nbetween the proposed deficit and the target agreed with the EU, effectively preparing the ground to \\n\\nbring Italy under the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). If the Italian government sticks to its \\n\\n2.4% of GDP deficit target – which so far it has said it will (La Repubblica, 22 October 2018) – then \\n\\nwe think the EC will have no option but to propose to bring Italy back under the EDP, to preserve its \\n\\ncredibility and avoid setting dangerous precedents. This could happen relatively quickly, even before \\n\\nthe end of the year (see Italy’s 2019 draft budget, 16 October 2018). Hence, there might still be more \\n\\n‘bad news’ for the market to digest in the next few weeks, creating some volatility, including the \\n\\npossibly of a downgrade by S&P on 26 October. \\n\\n \\n\\nChris Attfield \\n\\nIn a market where 30bp+ moves appear to be the ‘new normal’, forecasting is not about any \\n\\nmeasure of “fair value.” Even though a rating-based approach shows Italy is trading in deeply cheap \\n\\nterritory for an IG sovereign, we think this can easily continue in the medium term. For 2019, our \\n\\nbase case is still that a systemic crisis will be averted, and that redenomination risk will not be priced \\n\\ninto the market to any significant degree. Therefore, a level of 200bp by the end of next year seems \\n\\nreasonable: it may be optimistic, but we think 300bp is too wide for an equilibrium to be reached. \\n\\nAlthough Italian risks remain a concern, we note value in the short end of Spain as it has displayed \\n\\nlow volatility to BTPs in 2018 and relatively attractive carry (see The proper pricing of policy, 19 \\n\\nOctober 2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nLet’s talk about the implications across the asset classes. Subhrajit, do we see changes in the vol \\n\\ndynamic of rates markets? Is it different from what we’d seen in February this year? \\n\\n \\n\\nSubhrajit Banerjee \\n\\nWe can definitely see that rates vol has picked up in certain segments of the bond market. This is \\n\\nespecially notable with the EUR interest rate vol, which was quite low to begin with. An interesting \\n\\nphenomena is occurring when you compare short-dated vol. with long-dated vol, especially in the USD \\n\\nrates market. In February, when we saw a similar volatility pick-up, it was much more pronounced in \\n\\nshort-dated vol. versus long-dated vol. – a move stemming from uncertainty over monetary policy \\n\\nexpectations. This time, however, we are seeing a more aggressive pick-up in long-dated vols. This is \\n\\nan interesting development and something we will watch closely as it shows the rates vol. dynamic has \\n\\nchanged. \\n\\n \\n\\nSteven Major \\n\\nThis temporary move in the curve is getting a lot of attention. Are these moves mostly confined to real \\n\\nrates and its volatility? \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/Z6gthRvPjDIr\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/VpjL7FLxchvm\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nSubhrajit Banerjee \\n\\nYes. When we look at long-dated interest rate vol this can be split into two categories. One is real yield \\n\\nvol. and another one is inflation risk premia. Recently, the inflation risk premia has remained calm while \\n\\nvolatility is seen more on the real yield front. Adjustments happen on real yields, which begs the \\n\\nquestion about the uncertainty about the level of R*. \\n\\n Figure 4 : Vol seen to have increased mostly via the real yield channel \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n* Realised vol calculated using trailing 6m window \\n \\n\\n \\nSteven Major \\n\\nThe point we’d make more broadly is that the longer-term forward rates are barely above the Fed’s \\n\\nsupposed equilibrium rate. Larry, do you have anything to add on this? \\n\\n \\n\\nLawrence Dyer \\n\\nWe would expect a consolidation given the historical pattern – the high 5Y5Y forward rate (3.35%) \\n\\nsuggest the market is already pricing in the Fed’s tightening plans. So unless you anticipate that the \\n\\nFed could move its funds rate up towards 3.75% or more, there is little reason to expect long rates to \\n\\npush much higher. The distribution of the longer-run funds rate in the dot plot suggests the FOMC sees \\n\\nthe risks as biased to lower rate. One dot is at 3.5%, the other fifteen dots are below the current 5Y5Y \\n\\nforward. There are seven at 2.75% or less, and eight if you consider that one member refuses to even \\n\\nguess the longer-run rate, but has a 2.125% rate in 2021. \\n\\n \\n\\nMax Kettner \\n\\nFrom a multi-asset perspective, if real yields continue to rise and volatility picks up further, then that \\n\\nusually has implications for credit and equity. Although there is considerable uncertainty around the \\n\\nrelationship between real yields and equity multiples, a level of 10-year real yields of c1.5% was \\n\\nconsistent with equity multiples no longer expanding. Credit IG is more exposed to rates vol and HY is \\n\\nmore exposed to equity vol. So rising rates and equity volatility can negatively impact the risk profile of \\n\\nUSD credit, and probably EUR credit.  \\n\\n0.6\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.8\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n1.3\\n\\n1.4\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n60\\n\\n70\\n\\n80\\n\\n90\\n\\n100\\n\\nDec-15 Jun-16 Dec-16 Jun-17 Dec-17 Jun-18\\n\\nV\\no\\n\\nl r\\nat\\n\\nio\\n\\nR\\nea\\n\\nlis\\ned\\n\\n V\\no\\n\\nl *\\n  (\\n\\nb\\np\\n\\n)\\n\\nUSD 5y5y real yield vol USD 5y5y inflation swap vol Vol ratio (RHS)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n Figure 5 : A further rise in real yields may not support equity multiples \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nMark, you wrote that EUR FX volatility has a different dynamic to the rest of G10 FX. \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nFor most G10 currency pairs, realised vol is still at the low end of its previous six-month range. Yet for \\n\\nalmost all EUR crosses, realised vol is at the high end of its six-month range (see Data Matters: RORO \\n\\nResurgence, 17 October 2018). For example, we see EUR-JPY vol is high, but USD-JPY vol is low. \\n\\nClearly, this needs an EUR-specific explanation.  \\n\\nWe believe such behaviour might be due to worries about Italy, and to some extent Turkey. When \\n\\nTurkey was selling off, there were worries about contagion to the European banking system and, \\n\\nhence, European assets came under pressure. These are the sort of linkages that display the ways \\n\\nthat volatility can spill from one asset class to another. \\n\\n-5\\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12\\n\\nC\\nA\\n\\nP\\nE\\n\\nReal 10-year US Treasury yield (using CPI)\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdS\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdS\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n Figure 6: Most EUR crosses display higher vol \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, emerging markets have initiated a vol dynamic.

Instead \\n\\nwe have seen and continue to expect a gradual depreciation of the RMB over time. As such, we are \\n\\nforecasting USD-CNY at 7.10 by end-2019. But that gradual process would not substantially increase \\n\\nvolatility. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n \\n\\nMurat Ulgen \\n\\nFrom a top-down EM perspective, the key issues are trade protectionism, slowing growth, and \\n\\ntightening financial conditions. But coming back to the previous discussion about rising real rates – \\n\\nboth on the level and volatility – this has been an issue in so far that the real rate gap between EM and \\n\\nthe US is narrowing. Consequently, the re-pricing of risk premium in emerging markets may not be \\n\\nover. A narrowing gap will continue to be a drag on EM in the background. \\n\\n \\n\\nAndre De Silva \\n\\nThe real yield differential between EM and DM has indeed narrowed, but it is still sizeable. Moreover, if \\n\\none decomposes the individual countries this indicates more dispersion. The real yield bond valuations \\n\\nin Indonesia are quite generous in light of policy tightening during a period of subdued inflation. In \\n\\ncontrast, the surge in inflation in Turkey has put real yields in negative territory.  \\n\\nFor emerging market bonds, one key source of volatility has been EM FX and reflects a key \\n\\ncomponent of tightening of financial conditions that Murat Ulgen referred to earlier. Prior to September, \\n\\nEM FX had lost nearly 20% year-to-date. Since then we have seen these currencies stabilise or even \\n\\nbounce back somewhat. The main issues of Fed tightening and US-China trade tensions remain, but \\n\\nthese factors are well known. The policy adjustment from several EM countries is also starting to bite, \\n\\nranging from 150bp rate hikes from Indonesia, the second round of accelerated IMF funding for \\n\\nArgentina, and Russia surprising the markets with a rate hike and a sprinkling of other measures to \\n\\nrestrict imports and stem price pressures. One sign of a reassessment of EM bonds, even if FX risks \\n\\nremain, is the re-tightening of EM external debt spreads since the peak of above 400bp in the JPM \\n\\nEMBI during early September vs c300bp earlier this year.       \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nThanks Andre. We’ve seen some positive stories in EM. In Brazil, expectations about the election \\n\\ndelivering a market-friendly outcome has seen the BRL rally. In Turkey, the narrowing of the geo-\\n\\npolitical risk premium and a C/A surplus has seen the TRY rally.  \\n\\nMurat, could this be enough for EM volatility to fall and EM FX vols to settle down? \\n\\n \\nMurat Ulgen \\n\\nNo, not necessarily. I would still consider tightening financial conditions and trade protectionism as \\n\\nsecular dynamica in the background negatively impacting EM sentiment and therefore volatility. As \\n\\nRyan mentioned earlier, it doesn’t look like any of these factors will go away anytime soon. There is a \\n\\nG20 summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November. Unless there is a breakthrough on the ongoing \\n\\nUS-China trade disputes at this summit, it seems trade protectionism issues will likely linger into 2019. \\n\\nGiven the Fed’s trajectory, many EM economies with C/A deficits are seeing capital being withdrawn. \\n\\nHence, to stem the tide these countries have to raise interest rates – so further tightening financial \\n\\nconditions as we have already seen in 2Q18 and 3Q18. \\n\\nBoth issues not only present downside risk to EM growth but in certain countries upside risks to \\n\\ninflation as well (see GEMS Investor, 7 October 2018). \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/PdZRCSQ\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n9 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\n\\nAli Cakiroglu \\n\\nJust to add on EM growth – the consensus forecast is for 5% GDP growth in EM during 2019.

Where do we stand in terms of cross-asset correlations? Has \\n\\nthere been any significant shift during the recent sell-off? \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nIn the last edition of Data Matters (17 October 2018), we highlighted the resurgence of the classic Risk On / \\n\\nRisk Off pattern. The typical RORO correlation profile is positive correlations among risk-on assets, positive \\n\\ncorrelations among risk-off assets and, critically, a negative correlation between these two asset blocks. \\n\\nAlthough the overall level of correlations is nowhere near the extreme levels such as in 2012, that profile of \\n\\ncross asset correlations has come back.  \\n\\nWe’ve been highlighting for a while that we see signs of the RORO factor lurking in the background of cross-\\n\\nasset returns. What’s changed is that we now see a ‘RORO-esque’ heat map. Cross-asset correlations \\n\\nbegan to rise in August, so it’s not purely driven by the recent equity market sell-off. Interestingly, many \\n\\npeople are blaming higher yields for the sell-off in equities, which would suggest a positive correlation \\n\\nbetween bond and equity returns. However, there is still a negative correlation between the two. So while \\n\\nhigher yields are likely to be an important driver of the equity sell-off, this suggests to us that there have also \\n\\nbeen other drivers at work. Looking for a single factor that explains the equity sell-off is overly simplistic \\n\\nhere. \\n\\n Figure 9: Our RORO index has increased since August \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nFrom a multi-asset perspective, the issue is that when assets lose their specific identities, asset allocators \\n\\nfind it much more difficult to express specific views or themes to find effective diversification. Can you \\n\\nremind us what it was like when correlations were at their extremes? \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdSjvvqx\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nMark McDonald \\n\\nBack in 2012 most assets lost much of their individual character. Assets partitioned themselves into either a \\n\\nrisk-on or a risk-off bucket and the majority of their price action was explained by the common factor. This \\n\\ncaused significant problems for asset managers – there was little benefit to being an asset class expert \\n\\nduring this time since the overwhelming influence on the resulting P&L was the change in overall risk \\n\\nsentiment.  \\n\\nNow, clearly the correlations we’re seeing at the moment are nowhere near those levels. But the presence \\n\\nof this correlation structure coming back during a challenging time for markets does suggest that we may \\n\\nhave what I call a kind of ‘muscle memory’ in markets. Investors simply switch back to these risk on / risk off \\n\\nbehaviours at times of stress. \\n\\n Figure 10: Once again we see two clear blocks of assets: risk-on assets, and ‘safe havens’ \\n\\n \\nSource: Bloomberg, Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nDaniel Grosvenor \\n\\nFor equities, I think it is interesting that the relationship between the typical ‘bond proxy’ sectors and the \\n\\ndevelopment of rates seems to have broken down (see Global Equity Insights: Shaken but not stirred, 11 \\n\\nOctober 2018). Normally when bond yields rise these sectors tend to sell-off as well. But they have \\n\\nactually been quite resilient over the past month or so. I think this reflects their defensive nature and \\n\\nsuggests that investors are worried about the outlook for growth, consequently favouring these sectors. \\n\\nHaving underperformed for most of the past two years, defensives are now outperforming again. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n Figure 11 : Breaking down the bond-equity correlation \\n\\n \\nSource: Refinitiv Datastream, HSBC \\n \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nSo you think global equity markets are already transitioning to this new paradigm? \\n\\n \\nDaniel Grosvenor \\n\\nIn our Global Equity Strategy Quarterly, we wrote about the risk from a rise in volatility, particularly in DM, \\n\\nand the pressure this could have on valuations (see Global Equity Strategy: Extend and defend, 1 October \\n\\n2018). And I think this has already partly played out. The global 12m forward PE ratio has fallen to just \\n\\n14.2x. In January, it was almost 17x, and the long-term average is 15.8x. So valuations have already \\n\\ncorrected significantly.  \\n\\nThe issue is that these valuation multiples are underpinned by relatively strong consensus growth \\n\\nexpectations. If you get disappointment there, then of course equities don’t appear as cheap anymore. \\n\\nThis leads us to our preference for the US, as we are comfortable with the US earnings outlook where \\n\\nexpectations are for c10% EPS growth in 2019. We are more concerned elsewhere, and particularly in \\n\\nEurope where we see further downward revisions.  It is difficult to see what drives a reacceleration in \\n\\nEuropean earnings momentum from here (see European Equity Insights: Still waiting for a growth spurt, \\n\\n17 September 2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nThanks Dan. Steve is this an inflexion point? \\n\\n \\nSteven Major \\n\\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect about an inflexion point is that this does not necessarily tell us anything \\n\\nabout the future direction. It’s a turning point and we could simply go back to the old regime – we are simply \\n\\nnot meant to know until afterwards. If we’ve learned anything about the past ten years of QE and excess \\n\\ndebt is that traditional wisdom does not necessarily apply any longer. So I’m prepared to challenge the idea \\n\\nof historical precedence to make predictions (see Reversal: Behaviour shifts as QE era end, 31 August \\n\\n2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nFrom an asset allocation perspective, our view is that investors shouldn’t be complacent (Multi-asset \\n\\nStrategy, 5 October 2018). Rising correlations will impact portfolio construction and risk management. \\n\\nInvestors have to start thinking about moving toward more cautious allocations such as reducing credit \\n\\nexposure.  \\n\\n-80%\\n\\n-60%\\n\\n-40%\\n\\n-20%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n20%\\n\\n40%\\n\\n60%\\n\\n80%\\n\\nIn\\ndu\\n\\nst\\nria\\n\\nls\\n\\nF\\nin\\n\\nan\\nci\\n\\nal\\ns\\n\\nF\\nin\\n\\nan\\nci\\n\\nal\\ns\\n\\nE\\nne\\n\\nrg\\ny\\n\\nH\\nea\\n\\nlth\\n C\\n\\nar\\ne\\n\\nT\\nel\\n\\nec\\nom\\n\\ns\\n\\nU\\ntil\\n\\niti\\nes\\n\\nC\\non\\n\\ns.\\n S\\n\\nta\\npl\\n\\nes\\n\\nC\\non\\n\\ns.\\n D\\n\\nis\\nc.

The ingredients of higher \\n\\nUS Treasury yields, stronger dollar and tighter dollar financial conditions would in the past typically impact \\n\\nLatAm the most, especially Brazil and Mexico. However, this time around it’s driven much more by \\n\\nidiosyncratic stories. In Brazil, this has to do with elections and hopes for more market-friendly policies. In \\n\\nMexico, there is still the NAFTA risk being reduced. In contrast, Asia has very recently borne more the brunt \\n\\nof higher volatility. Perhaps this also has to do with the rise in oil prices, which Asia is much more exposed \\n\\nto, particularly India and to a certain degree also Indonesia. In China, concerns still linger about the trade \\n\\nconflict. So we think fundamentally there is a good reason why we have seen this shift of ‘old’ correlation \\n\\npatterns. \\n\\n \\nSubhrajit Banerjee \\n\\nWe’ve found similar dynamics in Data Matters (17 October 2018), for example in short-dated EM rates. \\n\\nAlthough most central banks have hiked rates there has been little correlation among them. So, they have \\n\\nnot really been hiking in a lock-step fashion. And the correlation among short-dated EM rates is also not that \\n\\nstrong. \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nOne question we have been getting is whether higher volatility and stronger cross-asset correlations \\n\\nchallenge our view of favouring USD assets. But we think favouring US Treasuries, US equities, and the \\n\\nUSD is actually totally consistent in this context. We are looking through the 2020 horizon where, on our \\n\\nforecasts, the US economy will slow to below-potential growth and the Fed will start cutting rates. I’d be \\n\\nsurprised that even during a sell-off and a further pick-up in volatility people would flee from the USD. \\n\\n+30bp\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n60\\n\\n70\\n\\n80\\n\\n90\\n\\n100\\n\\nDec 17 Feb 18 Apr 18 Jun 18 Aug 18 Oct 18 Dec 18\\n\\nA\\nss\\n\\net\\n s\\n\\nw\\nap\\n\\n s\\np\\n\\nre\\nad\\n\\n (b\\np\\n\\n)\\n\\nPrevious end-18 forecast  \\n\\nCurrent end-18 forecast +45bp\\n\\nEUR IG\\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/lKtmXdSjvvqx\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n \\nSteven Major \\n\\nAnd some view the story of a stronger USD and long US Treasuries as inconsistent, which I suppose comes \\n\\nfrom interest rate parity model type of thinking. But I think there is more to it. If we talk to our FX team, their \\n\\nsense is that the US is still quite well-positioned cyclically. But even if the US were to move to something \\n\\nquite nasty, the USD would also be benefitting. In fixed income, we are obviously more focusing on the latter \\n\\nscenario. And in our latest FIAA Look right through (3 October 2018), we are looking right to 2020 – and our \\n\\nforecasts are for rate cuts by the Fed. \\n\\n \\nDavid Bloom \\n\\nAs Steve alludes to, we currently see the USD continuing to outperform. As the Fed delivers on its “dots” in \\n\\nthe coming months, the positive cyclical story and levels of US short-end rates compared to its G10 \\n\\ncounterparts should continue to support a USD bull run. If we suppose that instead the US economy slows \\n\\nmaterially, forcing a possible policy reversal by the Fed, we would still argue that the USD would outperform. \\n\\nFirst, such a scenario would be risk-off in which the USD benefits, and second it is clear that after years of \\n\\ntightening, US policy is better placed to deal with a downturn than other G10 economies. Ultimately, we only \\n\\nsee the USD weakening in a ‘middle ground’ scenario where the Fed calls an early end to the tightening \\n\\ncycle and is comfortable that it has done enough to meet its twin mandate (see Currency Outlook: The \\n\\nrunning of the bulls, 13 September 2018). \\n\\n \\nPierre Blanchet \\n\\nThanks all for your contributions. \\n\\n \\n\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/vkpJLDX\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/FsJNLKS\\nhttps://www.research.hsbc.com/R/10/FsJNLKS\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n15 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nDisclosure appendix \\n\\nAnalyst Certification \\n\\nThe following analyst(s), economist(s), or strategist(s) who is(are) primarily responsible for this report, including any analyst(s) \\n\\nwhose name(s) appear(s) as author of an individual section or sections of the report and any analyst(s) named as the covering \\n\\nanalyst(s) of a subsidiary company in a sum-of-the-parts valuation certifies(y) that the opinion(s) on the subject security(ies) or \\n\\nissuer(s), any views or forecasts expressed in the section(s) of which such individual(s) is(are) named as author(s), and any other \\n\\nviews or forecasts expressed herein, including any views expressed on the back page of the research report, accurately reflect \\n\\ntheir personal view(s) and that no part of their compensation was, is or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific \\n\\nrecommendation(s) or views contained in this research report: Pierre Blanchet, Steven Major, CFA, Mark McDonald, Dr. Murat \\n\\nUlgen, David Bloom, Subhrajit Banerjee, CFA, Andre de Silva, CFA, Fabio Balboni, Chris Attfield, Daniel Grosvenor, Max Kettner, \\n\\nRyan Wang, Lawrence Dyer and Ali Cakiroglu \\n\\nImportant disclosures \\n\\nEquities: Stock ratings and basis for financial analysis \\n\\nHSBC and its affiliates, including the issuer of this report (“HSBC”) believes an investor\\'s decision to buy or sell a stock should \\n\\ndepend on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s existing holdings, risk tolerance and other considerations and that \\n\\ninvestors utilise various disciplines and investment horizons when making investment decisions.

When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n16 \\n\\nbe classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a \\n\\nHold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between \\n\\n5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% \\n\\nbelow the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. \\n\\nOur ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any \\'material change\\' (initiation or resumption of coverage, change \\n\\nin target price or estimates).  \\n\\nUpside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. \\n\\nPrior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: \\n\\nFor each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropriate, \\n\\nregional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the \\n\\nstock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, \\n\\nthe potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the \\n\\nforecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 \\n\\nmonths (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was \\n\\nexpected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage \\n\\npoints for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. \\n\\n*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months \\n\\n(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, stocks which \\n\\nwe did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the past month\\'s \\n\\naverage of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, \\n\\nvolatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock\\'s status to change. \\n\\nRating distribution for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nAs of 24 October 2018, the distribution of all independent ratings published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n \\nFor the purposes of the distribution above the following mapping structure is used during the transition from the previous to current \\n\\nrating models: under our previous model, Overweight = Buy, Neutral = Hold and Underweight = Sell; under our current model Buy \\n\\n= Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.  For rating definitions under both models, please see “Stock ratings and basis for financial \\n\\nanalysis” above. \\n\\nDefinitions for fundamental credit and covered bond recommendations from 22 April 2016 \\n\\nOverweight: For corporate credit, the issuer’s fundamental credit profile is expected to improve over the next six months.  For \\n\\ncovered bonds, the bonds issued in this country are expected to outperform those of the other countries in our coverage over the \\n\\nnext six months. \\n\\nNeutral: For corporate credit, the issuer’s fundamental credit profile is expected to remain stable over the next six months.  For \\n\\ncovered bonds, the bonds issued in this country are expected to perform in line with those of the other countries in our coverage \\n\\nover the next six months. \\n\\nUnderweight: For corporate credit, the issuer’s fundamental credit profile is expected to deteriorate over the next six months.  \\n\\nFor covered bonds, the bonds issued in this country are expected to underperform those of other countries in our coverage over \\n\\nthe next six months. \\n\\nPrior to this date, fundamental recommendations for corporate credit were applied on the following basis: \\n\\nOverweight: The credits of the issuer were expected to outperform those of other issuers in the sector over the next six months. \\n\\nNeutral: The credits of the issuer were expected to perform in line with those of other issuers in the sector over the next six \\n\\nmonths. \\n\\nBuy 53% ( 33% of these provided with Investment Banking Services ) \\n\\nHold 37% ( 31% of these provided with Investment Banking Services ) \\n\\nSell 10% ( 20% of these provided with Investment Banking Services ) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n17 \\n\\nMULTI-ASSET ● GLOBAL \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nUnderweight: The credits of the issuer were expected to underperform those of other issuers in the sector over the next six \\n\\nmonths. \\n\\nDistribution of fundamental credit and covered bond recommendations \\n\\nAs of 23 October 2018, the distribution of all independent fundamental credit recommendations published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n All Covered issuers Issuers to whom HSBC has provided Investment Banking in the past 12 months \\n\\n Count Percentage Count Percentage \\n\\nOverweight 97 24 45 46 \\nNeutral 223 55 103 46 \\nUnderweight 84 21 18 21 \\n\\nSource: HSBC     \\n\\nFor the distribution of non-independent ratings published by HSBC, please see the disclosure page available at \\n\\nhttp://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/financial-regulation/investment-recommendations-disclosures. \\n\\nRecommendation changes for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nTo view a list of all the independent fundamental ratings disseminated by HSBC during the preceding 12-month period, please \\n\\nuse the following links to access the disclosure page: \\n\\nClients of Global Research and Global Banking and Markets: www.research.hsbc.com/A/Disclosures \\n\\nClients of HSBC Private Banking: www.research.privatebank.hsbc.com/Disclosures \\n\\nHSBC and its affiliates will from time to time sell to and buy from customers the securities/instruments, both equity and debt \\n\\n(including derivatives) of companies covered in HSBC Research on a principal or agency basis or act as a market maker or \\n\\nliquidity provider in the securities/instruments mentioned in this report. \\n\\nAnalysts, economists, and strategists are paid in part by reference to the profitability of HSBC which includes investment banking, \\n\\nsales & trading, and principal trading revenues.  \\n\\nWhether, or in what time frame, an update of this analysis will be published is not determined in advance. \\n\\nNon-U.S. analysts may not be associated persons of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc, and therefore may not be subject to FINRA \\n\\nRule 2241 or FINRA Rule 2242 restrictions on communications with the subject company, public appearances and trading \\n\\nsecurities held by the analysts.  \\n\\nEconomic sanctions imposed by the EU and OFAC prohibit transacting or dealing in new debt or equity of Russian SSI entities. \\n\\nThis report does not constitute advice in relation to any securities issued by Russian SSI entities on or after July 16 2014 and as \\n\\nsuch, this report should not be construed as an inducement to transact in any sanctioned securities. \\n\\nFor disclosures in respect of any company mentioned in this report, please see the most recently published report on that company \\n\\navailable at www.hsbcnet.com/research.

Total revenue was \\n\\nlower because there was no port development income in 2QFY19 (vs. INR5.04bn in \\n\\n2QFY18 on account of CT4 Terminal sale to CMA CGM Joint Venture). ADSEZ’s \\n\\nreported PAT dropped 39% y-o-y, due mainly to an FX loss of INR5.7bn as the INR \\n\\ndepreciated 5.5% vs USD in 3Q18. However, its Port EBITDA grew 30% y-o-y and \\n\\nPort EBITDA margin improved to 70.1% (vs. 67.8% in 2QFY18), driven by strong \\n\\nrecovery of throughput growth (22% y-o-y vs 9% in 1QFY18). ADSEZ’s port portfolio \\n\\ncontinues to gain market share (22% growth vs India ports’ growth of 6%) as \\n\\ncontainer growth was up 16% (vs. Indian major ports’ growth of 9%), while crude \\n\\ncargo continued to rebound (up 42% y-o-y) following the reopening of the HMEL \\n\\nrefinery, which shut down last year for maintenance. Coal cargo also recovered (up \\n\\n35% y-o-y) after a decline in 1QFY19.  \\n\\nManagement were confident during the call. Management commented that \\n\\nADSEZ is on track to meet its 200MMT cargo volume guidance for FY19. Despite the \\n\\nuncertainties related to trade tariffs and INR depreciation, management noted that it \\n\\nhas not yet seen any slowdown in 3QFY19 to date. In 1HFY19, cargo volume was in \\n\\nexcess of 100MMT for the first time, with ports across the western and southern \\n\\ncoasts recording strong growth. \\n\\nWe increase FY19-20e recurring profit estimates as we tweak our assumptions to \\n\\nreflect the better throughput outlook and strong volumes in 2Q. Our throughput \\n\\nassumption increases by 3.4-3.6% in 2019-20e, which results in port EBITDA growth \\n\\nof 3.7-4.3% in 2019-20e and 4.4% growth on recurring profit during the period. We \\n\\nare now 3% and 4% above Bloomberg consensus on FY19e EBITDA and recurring \\n\\nprofit estimates, respectively. \\n\\nReiterate Buy but cut DCF-based TP to INR446 (vs INR490 previously): We now \\n\\nuse a WACC of 10.9% (vs. 10.3% previously) due to a higher risk-free rate of 3% (vs. \\n\\n2.5% previously) and a higher levered beta of 2.14 (vs.1.98 previously) reflecting an \\n\\nincrease in effective borrowing costs on USD-denominated debt for ADSEZ due to \\n\\ndepreciation in the INR vs USD.

We use a WACC of 10.9% (vs. 10.3% \\n\\npreviously) assuming a risk-free rate of 3% (vs. 2.5% previously), an equity risk premium of 6% \\n\\n(vs. 6.5% previously), and a higher levered beta of 2.14 (vs.1.98 previously) to reflect an \\n\\nincrease in effective borrowing costs on USD-denominated debt for ADSEZ due to depreciation \\n\\nin the INR vs USD. We forecast cash flow until FY27e and apply an unchanged 4% terminal \\n\\ngrowth rate beyond. Based on this approach, we arrive at a lower target price of INR446 (from \\n\\nINR490 previously) due to the higher WACC. Our target price implies a 41.4% upside from the \\n\\ncurrent share price. We reiterate our Buy rating on ADSEZ as we believe it is a long-term play \\n\\non India’s trade and infrastructure growth. \\n\\nKey downside risks include rising inter-group loans, sharp appreciation of the US dollar \\n\\nagainst the Indian rupee, a sharp increase in interest rates, and slower-than-expected \\n\\nthroughput growth. \\n\\n   \\n\\n12.

Ratings should not be used or \\n\\nrelied on in isolation as investment advice. Different securities firms use a variety of ratings terms as well as different rating \\n\\nsystems to describe their recommendations and therefore investors should carefully read the definitions of the ratings used in \\n\\neach research report. Further, investors should carefully read the entire research report and not infer its contents from the rating \\n\\nbecause research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts\\' views and the basis for the rating. \\n\\nFrom 23rd March 2015 HSBC has assigned ratings on the following basis: \\n\\nThe target price is based on the analyst’s assessment of the stock’s actual current value, although we expect it to take six to 12 \\n\\nmonths for the market price to reflect this.  When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will \\n\\nbe classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a \\n\\nHold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between \\n\\n5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% \\n\\nbelow the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. \\n\\nOur ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any \\'material change\\' (initiation or resumption of coverage, change \\n\\nin target price or estimates).  \\n\\nUpside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. \\n\\nPrior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: \\n\\nFor each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropriate, \\n\\nregional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the \\n\\nstock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, \\n\\nthe potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the \\n\\nforecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 \\n\\nmonths (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was \\n\\nexpected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage \\n\\npoints for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. \\n\\n*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months \\n\\n(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, stocks which \\n\\nwe did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the past month\\'s \\n\\naverage of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, \\n\\nvolatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock\\'s status to change. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITIES ● TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n10 \\n\\nRating distribution for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nAs of 23 October 2018, the distribution of all independent ratings published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n \\nFor the purposes of the distribution above the following mapping structure is used during the transition from the previous to current \\n\\nrating models: under our previous model, Overweight = Buy, Neutral = Hold and Underweight = Sell; under our current model Buy \\n\\n= Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.

Revenue was EUR4.3bn (1% miss vs \\n\\nconsensus), with 4.4% organic growth. Adjusted EBITA of EUR568m (13.2% margin) \\n\\nmissed consensus by 3%. Order intake remained strong, up 11% (15% in D&T and 6% in \\n\\nCCHI). Medium-term guidance of 4-6% organic growth and 100bps annual margin \\n\\nimprovement was reiterated. Growth was good in Diagnosis & Treatment (D&T) at 6% \\n\\norganic, although the rebound in Personal Health (PH) was softer than anticipated at 4% \\n\\nand Connected Care & Health Informatics (CCHI) was below expectations, down 2% \\n\\norganic, showing once again the lumpiness of the business. The adjusted EBITA margin \\n\\nimproved only 40bps (consensus looked for 60bps), in the face of a material 60bps \\n\\nmargin headwind from currency fluctuations, with slight improvements in PH (+10bps \\n\\nmargin y-o-y) and D&T (+40bps). Improvement in HealthTech Others (-EUR3m vs  \\n\\n-EUR19m in Q3 2017) could not offset the soft performance in CCHI (-190bps margin) on \\n\\nthe back of negative growth and an adverse product mix. \\n\\nAll-time high order book suggests good momentum…: At the conference call \\n\\nmanagement restated that the time lag between order intake and revenues has expanded \\n\\nin recent years, with projects more complex and needing longer execution time in CCHI \\n\\nand D&T; order intake and revenue time lags on average are taking c9-15 months. With \\n\\nthis year’s order intake growth at c10% (double digit in D&T and mid-single in CCHI), the \\n\\ncompany should enter a period of healthy organic growth performance. However, Q3 \\n\\ndemonstrated again how unpredictable revenue growth performance in CCHI can be. \\n\\n…but currency headwinds and initiatives to mitigate tariffs need to be digested: \\n\\nThe headwinds on margins from currency fluctuations were higher than we anticipated \\n\\nand, combined with management guiding for a EUR60m negative net impact from trade \\n\\ntariffs, lead us to cut our margin expectations by 20bps/70bps/60bps for 2018-20. We \\n\\nreduce our adjusted net profit estimates by c1-5% for 2019-20. \\n\\nNext stop CMD on 8 November 2018: We do not anticipate a change in guidance but \\n\\nexpect updates on current product innovations and how it plans to mitigate the current FX \\n\\nheadwinds on margins and execute on its initiatives to handle adverse impacts from trade \\n\\ntariffs, to reach its annual c100bps margin improvement target. \\n\\nBuy, new TP of EUR44: With a 1-5% cut in our estimates, we reduce our DCF-based \\n\\ntarget price to EUR44 from EUR45 and reiterate our Buy rating. We still see an attractive \\n\\nrisk/reward profile. \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nMAINTAIN BUY \\n\\nTARGET PRICE (EUR) PREVIOUS TARGET (EUR) \\n\\n44.00 45.00 \\n\\nSHARE PRICE (EUR)

remains strong \\n\\nLumpy performance in CCHI and margins hit by adverse currencies \\n\\nPhilips posted a mixed set of Q3 results, with solid 4.4% organic revenue growth, slightly below \\n\\nexpectations. However, the 60bps FX hit on adjusted EBITA margin led to only a 40bps margin \\n\\nimprovement in the quarter y-o-y, below consensus expectations of 80bps. Furthermore, the \\n\\nnegative growth in Connected Care & Health Informatics disappointed and overshadowed the \\n\\nvery strong 11% order intake growth. \\n\\nThe performance in Diagnosis & Treatment (6% organic growth and 15% order intake growth) \\n\\nwas broadly in line with expectations, although order intake momentum remains very strong. \\n\\nThe margin expanded only by 40bps, with the adjusted EBITA missed expectations by 9%. \\n\\nFaster equipment revenue growth than for services (equipment >6% in Q3 and service c2%) – \\n\\nwhich has higher margins – combined with capitalised R&D now being expensed in the P&L, led \\n\\nto a lower margin improvement than anticipated, despite the good top-line momentum. Growth \\n\\nremains strong in Ultrasound with double-digit growth, high-single digit in Image Guided \\n\\nTherapy and mid-single digit in Diagnostic Imaging. This reflects the company’s efforts to benefit \\n\\nfrom its investment in the high-growth areas of image guided therapy (c30% of D&T sales and \\n\\n12% of group sales), strong position in Ultrasound, and renewing c60% of its product portfolio \\n\\nthroughout  2017/18 compared to Q4 2016, which is paying off.  \\n\\nPersonal Health revenue saw a slight improvement to 4% organic growth, but this was less \\n\\nthan anticipated (consensus was looking for 5%). The company highlighted mid-single digit \\n\\ngrowth in Personal Care and Sleep & Respiratory Care. The top line and margins suffered from \\n\\ncurrency headwinds in Turkey and Argentina, trade sanctions in Iran and supply disruptions due \\n\\nto adverse weather conditions, including floods in Hong Kong and India. All this impacted \\n\\ngrowth by c80bps and margin by 80bps, as did increasing advertising and promotion initiatives, \\n\\nwhich took another 80bps of margin.  \\n\\nConnected Care & Health Informatics disappointed with minus 2% organic growth, with the \\n\\nmargin dropping by 190bps, now up only by 20bps after nine months. The company said growth \\n\\nhas been weak on the back of a weak underlying patient monitoring market, especially in the \\n\\nUS, which y-t-d is practically flat, and where it has a commanding market share of 50%. This \\n\\nsoft growth is on the back of modest order intake growth in 2017, although Q2 and Q3 2018 \\n\\nmid-single digit order intake growth suggests some improvement going into 2019.  \\n\\n \\n\\nQ3 results review  \\n\\nEURm Q3 2018a Q3 2017a y-o-y  Organic Consensus Diff \\n\\nSales 4,306 4,148 3.8% 4.4% 4,355 -1.1% \\nPersonal Health 1,678 1,650 1.7% 3.9% 1,711 -1.9% \\nDiagnosis & Treatment 1,753 1,638 7.0% 6.3% 1,775 -1.2% \\nConnected Care & Health Informatics 741 751 -1.3% -1.7% 762 -2.8% \\nHealth Tech other 134 108 24.1%  107 25.2% \\n\\nAdjusted EBITA 568 532 6.8%  584 -2.7% \\nPersonal Health 278 272 2.2%  291 -4.5% \\nDiagnostics & Treatment 212 191 11.0%  234 -9.4% \\nConnected Care & Health Informatics 81 96 -15.6%  99 -18.2% \\nHealth Tech other -3 -19 -84.2%  -39 -92.3% \\n\\nAdjusted EBITA margin 13.2% 12.8% 0.4 ppts  13.4% -0.2 ppts \\nPersonal Health 16.6% 16.5% 0.1 ppts  17.0% -0.4 ppts \\nDiagnostics & Treatment 12.1% 11.7% 0.4 ppts  13.2% -1.1 ppts \\nConnected Care & Health Informatics 10.9% 12.8% -1.9 ppts  13.0% -2.1 ppts \\nHealth Tech other -2.2% -17.6% 15.4 ppts  -36.4% 34.2 ppts \\n\\nEBIT 451 299 50.8%  431 4.6% \\n\\nSource: Company data, company collected consensus \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\nEQUITIES ● HEALTH CARE EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n4-5% estimate cut due to FX headwind and adverse trade tariffs \\n\\nCut our adjusted net profit estimates by 4-5% to reflect FX fluctuations and trade tariff \\n\\nheadwinds \\n\\nWe cut our adjusted net profit estimates by 4-5% for 2019 to 2020 to reflect the higher-than-\\n\\nanticipated currency headwinds dragging on margins and the guided EUR60m (c30bps margin \\n\\ndilutive) negative net effect on EBITA of the imposition of tariffs between the US and China, \\n\\nwhich will lead to some rearrangement of the supply chain. We expect Philips to deliver a 90bps \\n\\nmargin improvement in 2018, 70bps in 2019 and 100bps in 2020. The tariffs will require Philips \\n\\nto work on additional productivity measures to absorb these negative impacts in order to hit its \\n\\nc100bps annual margin improvement goal in 2019. As these mitigating initiatives will likely take \\n\\nup to three to six months, the adverse impact will be bigger in H1 2019 than H2 2019.

Our target price implies 39% upside. \\n\\nWe reiterate our Buy rating as we see Philips at the forefront of a changing US healthcare \\n\\nsystem gradually moving to value-based care. This is due to its leading position in health \\n\\ninformatics & patient monitoring and minimally invasive image- guided therapy equipment and \\n\\ndevices solutions. Furthermore, with strong order intake growth seen in recent quarters, we are \\n\\nconfident revenue momentum will remain healthy in 2018 and going into 2019 (HSBCe 5% \\n\\norganic growth for both years). Moreover, we believe Philips offers an attractive risk/reward \\n\\nprofile with a 13% adjusted EPS CAGR for 2017-20e and a 16.8x 2019e PE. \\n\\nRisks \\n\\nDownside risks include unforeseen product recalls, higher-than-expected ASP pressure, \\n\\nnegative effects from regulatory changes in the US, lower-than-expected margin progress in \\n\\nD&T or value-destroying M&A activities. The company failing to meet its guidance on top-line \\n\\ngrowth (4-6% organic growth annually to 2020) and margin improvements (+100bps adjusted \\n\\nEBITA margin improvements pa to 2020) would likely be seen as a negative. Additional adverse \\n\\ntariffs initiatives by China and the US and sharp currency fluctuation could lead to further margin \\n\\nheadwinds. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nEQUITIES ● HEALTH CARE EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nDisclosure appendix \\n\\nAnalyst Certification \\n\\nThe following analyst(s), economist(s), or strategist(s) who is(are) primarily responsible for this report, including any analyst(s) \\n\\nwhose name(s) appear(s) as author of an individual section or sections of the report and any analyst(s) named as the covering \\n\\nanalyst(s) of a subsidiary company in a sum-of-the-parts valuation certifies(y) that the opinion(s) on the subject security(ies) or \\n\\nissuer(s), any views or forecasts expressed in the section(s) of which such individual(s) is(are) named as author(s), and any other \\n\\nviews or forecasts expressed herein, including any views expressed on the back page of the research report, accurately reflect \\n\\ntheir personal view(s) and that no part of their compensation was, is or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific \\n\\nrecommendation(s) or views contained in this research report: Richard Latz and Dr. Daniel Grigat \\n\\nImportant disclosures \\n\\nEquities: Stock ratings and basis for financial analysis \\n\\nHSBC and its affiliates, including the issuer of this report (“HSBC”) believes an investor\\'s decision to buy or sell a stock should \\n\\ndepend on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s existing holdings, risk tolerance and other considerations and that \\n\\ninvestors utilise various disciplines and investment horizons when making investment decisions. Ratings should not be used or \\n\\nrelied on in isolation as investment advice. Different securities firms use a variety of ratings terms as well as different rating \\n\\nsystems to describe their recommendations and therefore investors should carefully read the definitions of the ratings used in \\n\\neach research report. Further, investors should carefully read the entire research report and not infer its contents from the rating \\n\\nbecause research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts\\' views and the basis for the rating. \\n\\nFrom 23rd March 2015 HSBC has assigned ratings on the following basis: \\n\\nThe target price is based on the analyst’s assessment of the stock’s actual current value, although we expect it to take six to 12 \\n\\nmonths for the market price to reflect this.  When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will \\n\\nbe classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a \\n\\nHold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between \\n\\n5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% \\n\\nbelow the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. \\n\\nOur ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any \\'material change\\' (initiation or resumption of coverage, change \\n\\nin target price or estimates).  \\n\\nUpside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. \\n\\nPrior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: \\n\\nFor each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropriate, \\n\\nregional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the \\n\\nstock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, \\n\\nthe potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the \\n\\nforecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 \\n\\nmonths (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was \\n\\nexpected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage \\n\\npoints for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. \\n\\n*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months \\n\\n(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, stocks which \\n\\nwe did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the past month\\'s \\n\\naverage of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, \\n\\nvolatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock\\'s status to change. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITIES ● HEALTH CARE EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n8 \\n\\nRating distribution for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nAs of 23 October 2018, the distribution of all independent ratings published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n \\nFor the purposes of the distribution above the following mapping structure is used during the transition from the previous to current \\n\\nrating models: under our previous model, Overweight = Buy, Neutral = Hold and Underweight = Sell; under our current model Buy \\n\\n= Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.

On its own, this may not seem like very \\n\\nexciting growth, but we think there were multiple underlying positives, which further \\n\\nreinforce our positive view on the stock. Firstly, inline with our expectations, 2Q \\n\\nshows that the Infrastructure business decline in the past few quarters is not a one-\\n\\nway street and has stabilised (refer to our note on this: Upgrade to Buy: Not all doom \\n\\nand gloom, 27 Jun 2018). Secondly, good Infra and ER&D business has led to better \\n\\norganic growth than expected at the beginning of the year. Thirdly, deal wins and \\n\\noutlook remain positive. The impact of a few banking clients in Europe is largely \\n\\nbehind it now. Fourthly, so far the M&A of IPs hasn’t imploded as many have feared \\n\\non the street. And finally, and perhaps most importantly, the stock is trading at an \\n\\nundemanding 12x FY20e EPS, with EPS factoring in an INR/USD rate of 72. Also, \\n\\nwe think it is worth noticing that 64% of the company’s employees in the US are \\n\\nlocals, which reduces the reliance on and risks around visa availability.  \\n\\n2Q highlights: USD revenue growth was 2.1% q/q (USD2,099m) versus street expectation \\n\\nof 2.2%. In cc terms, 2Q19 revenues were up 3.0%, in line with street expectations. On a \\n\\ny/y basis, growth improved to 6.8% in organic cc terms. EBIT margins came in at 19.9%, \\n\\na tad below street expectations of 20.1%. In terms of geographies, the US continues to \\n\\npost strong revenue growth, up 4.2% q/q. Europe declined 2.6% q/q in Q2 (down 5.6% \\n\\nq/q in Q1). In terms of verticals, Retail, Technology & Services and Life Sciences & \\n\\nHealthcare led the growth. Engineering and R&D Services saw strong growth, up 6.3% \\n\\nq/q; BPO was up 6.0% q/q. The company maintained its FY19 guidance of 9.5-11.5% \\n\\ngrowth in cc terms and 8.2-10.2% in reported terms (as compared to earlier guidance of \\n\\n9.5% to 11.5% in cc terms and 8.4% to 10.4% in reported terms during Q1). EBIT margin \\n\\nguidance remains unchanged at 19.5% to 20.5%. Modes 2 and 3 combined contributed \\n\\n~28% to total revenues. Mode 2 was up 5.3% q/q, while mode 3 revenues grew 10.4% \\n\\nq/q in cc terms. \\n\\nMaintain Buy with TP of INR1,180: We continue to value HCLT at 16x 12-m forward \\n\\nearnings, which is at a 10% premium to the shares’ five-year historical average. Our \\n\\ntarget price of INR1,180 implies upside of 20.4%. We have a Buy rating on HCLT on \\n\\nvaluation grounds, as its valuation discount appears to more than compensate for its \\n\\nrecent earnings growth slowdown. HCLT is the cheapest stock in the India IT sector \\n\\nacross large and mid-caps with the valuation difference to peers too stark, in our view. \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n \\nMAINTAIN BUY

Ratings should not be used or \\n\\nrelied on in isolation as investment advice. Different securities firms use a variety of ratings terms as well as different rating \\n\\nsystems to describe their recommendations and therefore investors should carefully read the definitions of the ratings used in \\n\\neach research report. Further, investors should carefully read the entire research report and not infer its contents from the rating \\n\\nbecause research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts\\' views and the basis for the rating. \\n\\nFrom 23rd March 2015 HSBC has assigned ratings on the following basis: \\n\\nThe target price is based on the analyst’s assessment of the stock’s actual current value, although we expect it to take six to 12 \\n\\nmonths for the market price to reflect this.  When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will \\n\\nbe classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a \\n\\nHold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between \\n\\n5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% \\n\\nbelow the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. \\n\\nOur ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any \\'material change\\' (initiation or resumption of coverage, change \\n\\nin target price or estimates).  \\n\\nUpside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. \\n\\nPrior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: \\n\\nFor each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropria te, \\n\\nregional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the \\n\\nstock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, \\n\\nthe potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the \\n\\nforecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 \\n\\nmonths (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was \\n\\nexpected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage \\n\\npoints for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. \\n\\n*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months \\n\\n(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, stocks which \\n\\nwe did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the past month\\'s \\n\\naverage of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, \\n\\nvolatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock\\'s status to change. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEQUITIES ● IT SERVICES \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n8 \\n\\nRating distribution for long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nAs of 23 October 2018, the distribution of all independent ratings published by HSBC is as follows: \\n\\n \\nFor the purposes of the distribution above the following mapping structure is used during the transition from the previous to current \\n\\nrating models: under our previous model, Overweight = Buy, Neutral = Hold and Underweight = Sell; under our current model Buy \\n\\n= Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.

Cash sovereigns gained 0.125-0.25pt so far \\n\\nwith PHILIP outperforming INDON. CDS tightened 1-3bp into noon. Spreads in the \\n\\ninvestment-grade space were largely unchanged this morning. On the other hand, \\n\\nChinese corporate names in the high-yield space were better offered.  \\n\\nOn rating actions, Moody’s downgraded GCL New Energy’s rating to “B1” from “Ba3”, \\n\\nand subsequently lowered its senior unsecured rating to “B2” from “B1”, concluding \\n\\nMoody’s review for downgrade that was initiated on 18 September 2018. The \\n\\ndowngrade reflects the company’s heightened pressure from the upstream industry, \\n\\nwhich has resulted in the deterioration of GCL New Energy’s credit quality. The \\n\\nrating’s outlook is stable.

Net interest income at 9.3% higher y-o-y was the \\n\\nmajor driver, due to a combination of continued loan growth (gross loans +7.9% y-o-y), firm \\n\\nmargins (which have been in a narrow range of 2.33-2.36% for the past four quarters) and \\n\\nhigher loan-to-deposit ratio (gross LDR now at 79.9% versus 77.3% a year ago). Provisioning \\n\\ncosts are stable at RMB33bn (c1% of average gross loans, annualised). Overall annualised \\n\\nreturn on average assets was little changed from a year ago at 1.17%. \\n\\nBalance sheet structure: Zooming in on this quarter’s lending trend, retail lending (+3.7% q-o-\\n\\nq) continued to outpace corporate loans (+1.2% q-o-q). The bank also increased its investment \\n\\nbook with an RMB267bn or 20% q-o-q increase under “fair value through other comprehensive \\n\\nincome” category, which, according to the bank’s 1H18 report, was primarily onshore bond \\n\\ninvestments. Total financial investment therefore jumped 6% q-o-q to RMB5.6trn. Deposits have \\n\\nyet to see a substantial pick-up at a pace of 1.5% q-o-q, but the breakdown shows some \\n\\nimprovement in retail deposits (+4.1% q-o-q). \\n\\nAsset quality: Headline gross NPL ratio edged 1bp lower this quarter to 1.47%, while allowance to \\n\\ntotal loans and NPL coverage ratio were also steady at 2.86% and 195%, respectively.  \\n\\nCapitalisation improvement came from a 26bp q-o-q increase in the CET-1 ratio and RMB43bn of \\n\\nonshore T2 bond issuance in September. The papers are 10NC5 and carry a coupon of 4.86%. \\n\\nNote this is the first part of the RMB96bn-equivalent T2 issuance plan onshore plus offshore \\n\\nannounced in 2017. There is another RMB40bn onshore T2 in the pipeline (pricing guidance at 4.6-\\n\\n4.9%, source: ChinaBond, 24 Oct). Hence, there is still a possibility for up to RMB13bn-equivalent \\n\\nfuture offshore T2 primary supply. Separately, risk-weighted assets were up by a mild 2% q-o-q, \\n\\nsuggesting some of the incremental investments could be government or financial related in nature.   \\n\\nWe maintain our Neutral fundamental recommendation for CCB given its stable standalone \\n\\ncredit profile, government ownership and significant domestic market share. Upside and \\n\\ndownside risks are linked to the asset quality and China sovereign’s credit profile. We have a \\n\\nbuy call on CCB 4.65% Perp-20c (AT1). We believe the quick onshore capital replenishment \\n\\nindicates commitment for improvement in the capital structure. The AT1 bond currently yields \\n\\n5.1% (YTC, mid), lower than current 5-year UST yield + reset spread (6%). Key downside risk is \\n\\nthe potential offshore T2 issuance failing to attract enough investor interest.     \\n\\n   \\n\\nChristopher Li \\nAssociate \\n\\nThe Hongkong and Shanghai \\nBanking Corporation Limited \\n\\nchristopherbli@hsbc.com.hk \\n\\n+852 2822 3232 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFIXED INCOME ● CREDIT \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\nCCB: Consolidated financial summary \\n\\nYear to Dec (RMBm) 3Q17 2Q18 3Q18 y-o-y  \\n\\nIncome statement      \\nInterest income 192,077  196,179  209,439  9.0% 6.8% \\nInterest expense (76,607) (79,375) (83,200) 8.6% 4.8% \\nNet interest income 115,470  116,804  126,239  9.3% 8.1% \\nOther operating income 29,719  41,007  30,097  1.3% -26.6% \\nOperating income 145,189  157,811  156,336  7.7% -0.9% \\nOperating expenses (40,471) (38,448) (40,948) 1.2% 6.5% \\nPre-provision profits 104,718  119,363  115,388  10.2% -3.3% \\nImpairment losses on loans  (25,600) (28,238) (32,667) 27.6% 15.7% \\nImpairment losses on other assets (854) (302) (324) -62.1% 7.3% \\nProfits of associates & JVs 178  104  17  -90.4% -83.7% \\nPre-tax income 78,442  90,927  82,414  5.1% -9.4% \\nTaxation (15,178) (17,538) (15,023) -1.0% -14.3% \\nMinority interests (361) (177) (310) -14.1% 75.1% \\nNet income 62,903  73,212  67,081  6.6% -8.4% \\n      \\nKey balance sheet items 3Q17 2Q18 3Q18 y-o-y q-o-q \\nDeposits 16,502,595  16,965,489  17,228,192  4.4% 1.5% \\nAdvances 12,446,044  13,068,482  13,371,737  7.4% 2.3% \\nTotal assets 22,053,943  22,805,182  23,354,078  5.9% 2.4% \\nTotal equity 1,708,626  1,864,577  1,938,849  13.5% 4.0% \\n      \\nKey ratio 3Q17 2Q18 3Q18   \\nProfitability      \\nROAA 1.2% 1.3% 1.2%   \\nPre-provision profits/Average assets 1.9% 2.1% 2.0%   \\nNet interest margin 2.20% 2.33% 2.34%   \\nCost-income ratio 27.9% 24.4% 26.2%   \\nAsset quality      \\nGross NPL ratio 1.50% 1.48% 1.47%   \\nGross NPLs        190,949         198,754         201,821    \\nLoan Loss Res./NPLs 163% 193% 195%   \\nAllowances to total loans 2.44% 2.85% 2.86%   \\nCapital structure      \\nTotal CAR 14.7% 15.6% 16.2%   \\nTier-1 ratio 13.0% 13.7% 13.9%   \\nCET1 ratio 12.8% 13.1% 13.3%   \\nFunding      \\nLoan-to-deposit ratio 75.4% 77.0% 77.6%   \\nLoan/Assets 56.4% 57.3% 57.3%   \\n\\nSource: Company data, HSBC \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTrading call history  \\n\\n Bond Date From To Bid Px Ask Px YTC bid YTC ask \\n\\nChina Construction Bank CCB 4.65 Perp-20c 2/7/2018 N/A Buy 100.25 100.5 4.5 4.4 \\n\\nSource: Bloomberg, HSBC \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf061\\uf062\\uf063\\uf020\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\nFIXED INCOME ● CREDIT \\n\\n24 October 2018 \\n\\nDisclosure appendix \\n\\nAnalyst Certification \\n\\nThe following analyst(s), economist(s), or strategist(s) who is(are) primarily responsible for this report, including any analyst(s) \\n\\nwhose name(s) appear(s) as author of an individual section or sections of the report and any analyst(s) named as the covering \\n\\nanalyst(s) of a subsidiary company in a sum-of-the-parts valuation certifies(y) that the opinion(s) on the subject security(ies) or \\n\\nissuer(s), any views or forecasts expressed in the section(s) of which such individual(s) is(are) named as author(s), and any other \\n\\nviews or forecasts expressed herein, including any views expressed on the back page of the research report, accurately reflect \\n\\ntheir personal view(s) and that no part of their compensation was, is or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific \\n\\nrecommendation(s) or views contained in this research report: Christopher Li and Roanna Chau \\n\\nImportant disclosures \\n\\nFixed income: Basis for financial analysis \\n\\nThis report is designed for, and should only be utilised by, institutional investors.  Furthermore, HSBC believes an investor\\'s \\n\\ndecision to make an investment should depend on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s existing holdings and other \\n\\nconsiderations. \\n\\nHSBC believes that investors utilise various disciplines and investment horizons when making investment decisions, which \\n\\ndepend largely on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s existing holdings, risk tolerance and other considerations. Given \\n\\nthese differences, HSBC has three principal aims in its fixed income research: 1) to identify long-term investment opportunities \\n\\nbased on particular themes or ideas that may affect the future earnings or cash flows of companies in corporate credit and based \\n\\non country-specific ideas or themes that may affect the performance of these bonds in the case of covered bonds, in both cases \\n\\non a six-month time horizon; 2) to identify trade ideas on a time horizon of up to three months, relating to specific instruments and \\n\\nsegments of the yield curve, which are predominantly derived from relative value considerations or driven by events and which \\n\\nmay differ from our long-term credit opinion on an issuer. Buy or Sell refer to a trade call to buy or sell that given instrument; 3) to \\n\\nexpress views on the likely future performance of sectors, benchmark indices or markets in our fixed income strategy products. \\n\\nHSBC has assigned a fundamental recommendation structure, as described below, only for its long-term investment opportunities. \\n\\nHSBC believes an investor\\'s decision to buy or sell a bond should depend on individual circumstances such as the investor\\'s \\n\\nexisting holdings and other considerations. Different securities firms use a variety of terms as well as different systems to describe \\n\\ntheir recommendations. Investors should carefully read the definitions of the recommendations used in each research report. In \\n\\naddition, because research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts\\' views, investors should carefully \\n\\nread the entire research report and should not infer its contents from the recommendation. In any case, recommendations should \\n\\nnot be used or relied on in isolation as investment advice. \\n\\nHSBC Global Research is not and does not hold itself out to be a Credit Rating Agency as defined under the Hong Kong Securities \\n\\nand Futures Ordinance. \\n\\nDefinitions for fundamental credit and covered bond recommendations from 22 April 2016 \\n\\nOverweight: For corporate credit, the issuer’s fundamental credit profile is expected to improve over the next six months.
